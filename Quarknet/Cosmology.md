**Intro**

- There are 2 areas of study in particle physics
	- Cosmology
		- Study of the large scale structure of the universe
		- How big is the universe?
		- Where did the universe come from?
		- What is the fate of the universe?
		- Are there other universes? How many?
	- Elementary Particle Physics
		- Study of the small scale structure of the universe
		- What are the basic building blocks?
		- How do they interact with one another?
		- Is there a smallest amount of space and time
		- Is there a theory of everything


**Elementary Particle Physics**

- Why we need collisions of such high energy in order to probe the small scale universe?
	- To observe small particles, we need more energy
	- In order to probe shorter distances, we need to have wavelengths that are smaller than that in order to observe it
- Everything has a particle and a wave-like nature
	- The energy is inversely proportional to wavelength
		- An electron with a higher energy would have a smaller wavelength
- The LHC's energy scale is $10^3$ GeV
	- This allows us to look at distances as small as $10^{-19}$
	- Temperature of $10^{16}$ Kelvin
		- Closer to during the big bang
		- Roughly $10^{-12}s$ after the Big Bang


**Cosmology**

- Pre-20th century
	- Starts fixed points in space - Steady state universe
	- Universe unchanging
- 20th century
	- Einstein's General Relativity (1915)
	- Alexander Friedman (1922)
		- Applied general relativity to the whole universe 
		- $(v/r)^2$ ~ energy density (proportional to the energy density)
		- What is the energy density due to?
			- $E = mc^2$
			- About one hydrogen atom per cubic meter - $1 GeV/m^3$
		- Cosmological constant - $(\frac{v}{r})^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}P_m - \Lambda$
			- Einstein wanted to save the steady state universe
			- The fudge factor is the lambda
	- Hubble Expansion (1927)
		- Velocity of the galaxy's that are moving away is proportional to distance
		- He came up with this before Einstein's cosmological constant
		- Einstein called the cosmological constant his biggest mistake
	- Penzias and Wilson (1965)
		- Found the CMB
			- Remnant radiation (photons) left over from 380000 years after the Big Bang
			- Cooled from 3000 K to 2.7 K
				- The universe was hot enough that mostly plasma and there were ions that released many photons that is now captured in the CMB
				- The reason why the photons have become microwaves is because the universe is expanding and causing the wavelengths of the photons to increase


**Dark Matter**

- Things that we see
	- Baryonic matter
	- Observed via photons
- Everything made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons is only 4.6% of the mass-energy of the Universe
	- And only 10% of that is near stars and stuff
	- Everything else in the Universe is made up of Dark Matter (26%) and Dark Energy
- Dark matter does not interact with EMF and it also doesn't interact with itself very much

- 4 pieces of evidence

	- Rotation Curves
		- Something spinning around a central point must have a force pulling inwards to keep it on the curved path
			- In stars, that is gravity and is proportional to the mass between the star and the galactic center
		- We expect the speed of stars at the outer edge and center of the galaxy to spin slower.
		- However, we noticed that the speed increased as you go further and remained constant
		- This made no sense because this would cause the galaxy to blow apart due to the speed
		- In 1933, Zwicky measured the speeds of galaxies in the Coma Cluster, and the estimated mass of all the stars and gas. He found that he needed that roughly 160 times mire material to explain the speed of galaxies than available. Modern measurements put that as 10 times.
		- Therefore, there had to be additional mass keeping the galaxy together
			- Dark matter

	- Cosmic Microwave Background
		- Plasma does not allow photons to pass
		- Universe was so hot, electrons could not be bound into atomic orbitals
		- 370000 years after the Big Bang, cools enough for electrons to be bound
			- This allows for the photons to be "free"
		- The "surface of last scattering"
		- There are hot and cold patches due to the some photons that were slightly hotter or colder than the universe's average
			- This is due to over- or under-densities in matter
		- Pressure waves of photons move through the Universe, "fall" into overdense regions
			- Matter in the overdense regions heats up, causing photon sound waves to rebound

	- Big Bang Nucleosynthesis

	- "Direct" images
		- Dark matter can be seen when something is bending light where the baryons aren't

	- Another evidence is computer simulations that match observations
		- A computer that can simulate a universe showed that dark matter allows for the clustering that we see in the CMB

- What might dark matter be?
	- Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS)

- Energy does not have to be conserved
	- Noether's Theorem


**Session 3**

- Cosmology in 1970
	- $(\frac{v}{r})^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}P_m - \Lambda$
	- $\Omega _K = -\frac{}{}$
	- $1 = \Omega _m + \Omega _K$
		- m -> 0.05 and K -> 0.95 (Contribution from curvature of the universe)
	- Expansion dominated by negative curvature
	- Relatively small R
	- This is wrong because it does not take into account of dark matter
- Now 1980s - 1990s
	- 80% of universe is dark matter
	- $1 = \Omega _m + \Omega _{dark matter} + \Omega _{K}$
- 1998
	- Riess, Perimutter and Schmidt found out that the expansion rate of the universe is increasing over time
	- The rate of expansion is measured by measuring the light emitted by a type 1a supernova because its light emitted is constant. Then redshift is measured and the velocity and the distance can be found
	- The rate of the expansion of the univer was decreasing, but roughly 3 billion years ago, it started to increase
	- $1 = \Omega _m + \Omega _{dark matter} + \Omega _{\Lambda} + \Omega _{K}$
		- m -> 0.05, darkmatter -> 0.25, $\Lambda$ -> 0.7, $K \approx 0$ 
		- In a few years, the rate of expansion due to dark energy will increase while from matter and dark matter will get smaller

- Dark energy is the energy of vacuum
	- It has a fixed energy density that doesn't change as the universe expands
		- $\Omega _\Lambda$ is constant
	- As the universe is expanding, the density of dark matter and matter is decreasing, so the universe's rate of expansion should get lesser
	- However, it does starts increasing because of dark energy
	- As the universe expands, the energy in a vacuum remains constant, therefore, there is more energy
	- In the future, contributions of dark matter and matter to the expansion will be 0 while contributions due to dark energy will become 1
	- $\frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_{\Lambda} = \Lambda = (\frac{v}{r})^2$
	- $\frac{v}{r} = \sqrt{\Lambda}$
	- $v = \frac{dr}{dt} = \sqrt{\Lambda}r$
	- $r = r_0e^{\sqrt{\Lambda}t}$
		- This shows exponential growth
	- Current doubling time of the universe is 10 billion years


**Session 4**

- $\Lambda CDM$ Cosmology
	- Dark energy is the largest contribution to expansion
	- The universe is nearly or completely flat
- What happened before recombination
	- $10^-12 s$ -> $10^{16} K$ -> Limit of our knowledge
	- $10^-6 s$ -> $10^{12} K$ -> Protons and neutrons form
	- $1s$ -> $10^{10} K$ matter and anti-matter annihilate
	- $10s$ $10^{10} K$ -> Photon dominance (e+e- annihilation)
	- 3 min -> $10^9 K$ nucleosynthesis
		- Nuclei could form
		- After some time, then this process stops because it becomes too cold for nuclei to form
		- Very light nuclei were made like the isotopes of hydrogen, helium and lithium
		- Rest of the nuclei up to iron are made in stars while the rest are made in supernovas
	- $4 * 10^5$ years 3000K -> atoms form (CMB from this era)
		- Roughly the same as the temperature on the surface of the sun
		- Universe became transparent

- Problems with the big bang
	- Where are magnetic monopoles?
		- Needed for combining the 3 interactions in the standard model
	- Why is the universe so flat?
	- Why are distant parts of the universe in thermal equilibrium? The horizon problem?
		- At the big bang, the universe was not a singularity - It had some size
			- The visible universe was about the size of a meter
		- We see CMB coming from all around us; the temperature of the photons coming from either side have essentially the same temperature even though those 2 sides have never been in contact with each other.

- Inflation Theory
	- Around $10^{-32}s$, the universe increased in size by more than $10^{26}$
	- Doubling time here would be $10^{-34}s$
		- Current doubling time is $10^{10}$ years
	- Dark energy was driving the inflation
		- $r = r_\circ e^{\sqrt{\Lambda}t}$
		- At that time, $\sqrt{\Lambda}$ was much greater
		- It expanded rapidly because it had a lot of dark energy
		- Expanded until dark energy goes almost to zero
		- And then the universe started reheating and the big bang
		- Quantum Fluctuations
			- Vacuum energy fluctuations inversely proportional to distance probed
				- There is a limit 
			- For example
				- An electron and positron form and then annhialiate again
				- At small time scales, energy is not conserved
					- As you violate more of the energy conservation, you have less time in order to violate it
- 3 Main constants
	- Planck's constant (quantum mechanics) - $\hbar$ -> $1.06 \times 10^{-34} J\cdot s$
	- Speed of light (special relativity) - $C$ -> $3 \times 10^8 m/s$
	- Universal gravitation constant - $G$ -> $6.67\times10^{-11} J \cdot m/kg$
- If you put more and more energy (mass) into a smaller and smaller volume, you would get a black hole
	- Planck's constant is the limit to which we can probe to
- Natural value for the dark energy constant
	- Planck energy in Planck Cube is 124 order of magnitude larger than the measured value for $\Lambda$
	- Biggest mistake in all of science
- Steven Weiberg calculated the upper limit of cosmological constant that would allow for us to be here (1987)
- Larger valuese would cause the universe to expand too quickly for galaxies, stars, etc to form
- String Theory
	- Lives in 10 spatial dimensions 
	- Strings instead of quarks
	- This theory led to the idea of $10^{1000}$ different universes and prompted the idea of a multiverse
- Multiverse
	- ![[Cosmology 2022-07-12 14.40.52.excalidraw]]
	- Vacuum energies like this can explain a multiverse
- Scale of quantum gravity
	- Eneregy -> $10^{19}$ GeV
	- Distance -> $10^{-35}$
- Scale of LHC
	- Energy -> $10^3$ GeV
	- Distance
- Inconsistency in the measurement of the Hubble constant from 2 different methods
	- Using the Cosmic Microwave background
		- 67.8
	- Using Cosmic distance ladder
		- 73.52
