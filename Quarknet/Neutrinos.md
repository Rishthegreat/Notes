**Session 2**

- The numerical value of the momentum and energy of the neutrino is the same because in $E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$ , the energy due to mass is neglegible
	- The neutrino interacts with a Carbon 12 neutron, producing (hopefully) a muon and a proton
	- Once the momentum of a neutrino is measured, you can estimate the size of the Carbon-12 nucleus using the Heisenberg Uncertainity Principle
 

**Session 3**

- A low energy photon can give a little kick to an electron causing it to move
- At high energy, photons have enough energy to create an electron and positron pairs
	- Then the electron will release photons as it passes through the electromagnetic field generated by the nucleus of an atom
	- This process would continue until all the energy is used up

- Neutrino Oscillations
	- Neutrinos appear to change type over time
	- We can estimate the number of neutrinos produced in the sun because we know the sun's mass and we can estimate the amount of energy from fusion reaction in the sun from fusion reactions we do here on earth. Then, we can estimate the number of neutrinos produced
	- ![[Neutrinos 2022-07-11 09.15.35.excalidraw]]
	- The neutrinos we observe are a way that these 3 different waves align
	- So fundamentally, each neutrino is a combination of all flavors as they oscillate between them
	- In this, conservation of lepton numbers is not conserved
	- The probability of a neutrino changing flavors depends on the distance L, energy E and $\Delta m^2 , \theta$ (nature)
	- In order to create an imbalance between matter and anti-matter that we observe, we need to have at least 3 generations of neutrinos in order for the math to work out


**Session 4**

- Liquid Argon TPCs
	- Starts with a huge tank of liquid Argon
	- When a charged particle like a muon goes through, it ionizes atoms and a flash of light appears
	- There is an electric field across the Argon tank and this pulls the ionized electrons to the wires at the bottom in different orientations and we can then picture the event like the Minerva data we looked at
