#### What is a species?
- Biologists
	- Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated ([[Reproductive Isolation]]) from other such groups
		- However, if 2 groups are separated by a physical barrier, but could mate if barrier was not present, they would still be considered the same species
- Ecologists
	- A species is a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources in the environment
		- Species have different physical characteristics, or morphologies
- Broadly accepted idea
	- Interbreeding (Actually or potentially)
	- Do not reproduce with other groups
	- Look different
	- Adapted to different resources
- Bacteria do not really have species because they reproduce without a partner
	- Bacteria species are defined by differences in DNA sequences
- Fossils cannot be analyzed for who they reproduced with
	- Fossil species are defined by differences in anatomy, age, and where they were found
- Basically, the best way to define a species is based upon what you are studying and what you are trying to do
