## Background
- The south was ruled by the Jim Crow Laws
- Very few African-Americans voted
- “Defacto Segregation” - Segregation that is not by the law
- WW2 brought a lot of jobs to the African Americans
	- Racism and segregation still very prevalent, but more opportunites
- African-Americans being to move northward and switch from Republicans to Democratics
- Urban Black Middle Class begin to rise as more educational and career opportunities arise
- Cold War showed the hypocritical nature of America as they wanted freedom abroad, but surpressed at home
- Baseball was the most popular sport to watch
	- Jackie Robinson in 1947 was a great baseball player and he was black
- Emmett Till (1955) was spending his time at his uncle’s house
	- Outside a shop, there was a white girl and rumors say that he whistled at her, or did not even do anything
	- Later, a white mob killed Till and dumped him in the river
	- It awakened the North to the segregation in the South
	- The White killers were not found guilty
- NAACP Legal Defense Team
	- Thurgood Marshall
- All These events are the reason why we see some push for change in the 50s and 60s
## Movements/Rulings
### Brown vs Board of Education
- Before Brown vs Board of Education in 1954, many southern states required segregated schools
- The Chief Justice was Earl Warren
	- As the Chief Justice, he made a lot of liberal rulings and Eisenhower did not like him even though he appointed him
- 14th amendment says that all classes of citizens need to have the same laws and therefore equality, therefore, segregation is inherently unequal
	- Many studies were conducted that showed that segregation develops a mindset of inferiority in the African Americans
- 10 years after the ruling, the South still had not integrated their schools
	- Massive Resistance - Southern Manifesto
		- The South would do anything to resist racial integration
	- In some cases, the public schools would close, the white kids would go to private schools and the African-Americans had to work hard to find education
	- It took a lot of time and this is considered the start of the civil rights movement
### Montgomery Bus Boycott - Dec 1955
- Rosa Parks was a seamstress who was just arrested
	- Member of the NAACP
	- One of the few Women in Alabama registered to vote
- Many African-Americans were arrested and NAACP was waiting for the right person to be arrested
- So, the day after she was arrested, the African Americans refused to take the bus and lasted for about a year
- This is when Dr. King rose as the face of the civil rights movement
	- He was new to Montgomery as a Baptist leader
	- He was from a middle-class family who had a decent sum of money
	- He promoted the boycott
- Montgomery fought against this and arrested people like King and went all the way to the Supreme Court
	- It ruled that the busses must integrate
- This was the first massive movement of the civil rights movement
### Little Rock Central High - Fall of 1957
- This was an all white central high school
- There were federal rulings that this school must integrate as an experiment to see how it went
- They chose a few African-Americans who had high grades to attend
	- 9 black teenagers
	- Contemporaties of Emett Till
- The governor of Arkansas was a moderate on Civil Rights and he supported this - his name was Faubus
	- So his political career was over if he continued on this path
	- So, he thus used the National Guard to prevent the black kids from going to school
- Out of the 9 kids, 8 of them went together and were denied by the National Guard
	- 1 of them went alone and many white kids insulted her and threatened to kill her
- Eisenhower talks to the governor to let this happen and thinks that he has convinced him
	- However, 2 weeks later when the kids try to come again, the local police were there to protect the kids
	- The police did not fight against the mob because they did not want to fight against the whites
- To stop the riots and mob, Eisenhower places the army in Arkansas to ensure that the kids stay in school
	- Then next year, the schools closed
### Sit in Movement 1960
- Many department stores used to have restaurants in them
- A group of 4 African American college students went to one of them that was reserved for whites and waited to be served
	- Greensboro Four, North Carolina
- A movement sparked from this and many were beaten, and arrested
- This was coordinated
	- Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee - SNCC
- They kept doing this to keep pressure on Southern cities
- This was somewhat successful in Nashville
### Civil Rights Groups
- There were many different Civil Rights groups
- Many leader of these movements were ministers, reverends, and pastors due to the integration of Christianity in African-American culture
#### The Souther Christian Leadership Conference
- Led by Dr. King
- Kings influences came from
	- Gandhi and India
	- Civil Disobedience - Henry 
- The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee - SNCC
