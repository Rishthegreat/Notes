## Background
- The south was ruled by the Jim Crow Laws
- Very few African-Americans voted
- “Defacto Segregation” - Segregation that is not by the law
- WW2 brought a lot of jobs to the African Americans
	- Racism and segregation still very prevalent, but more opportunites
- African-Americans being to move northward and switch from Republicans to Democratics
- Urban Black Middle Class begin to rise as more educational and career opportunities arise
- Cold War showed the hypocritical nature of America as they wanted freedom abroad, but surpressed at home
- Baseball was the most popular sport to watch
	- Jackie Robinson in 1947 was a great baseball player and he was black
- Emmett Till (1955) was spending his time at his uncle’s house
	- Outside a shop, there was a white girl and rumors say that he whistled at her, or did not even do anything
	- Later, a white mob killed Till and dumped him in the river
	- It awakened the North to the segregation in the South
	- The White killers were not found guilty
- NAACP Legal Defense Team
	- Thurgood Marshall
- All These events are the reason why we see some push for change in the 50s and 60s
## Causes
### Brown vs Board of Education
- Before Brown vs Board of Education in 1954, many southern states required segregated schools
- The Chief Justice was Earl Warren
	- As the Chief Justice, he made a lot of liberal rulings and Eisenhower did not like him even though he appointed him
- 14th amendment says that all classes of citizens need to have the same laws and therefore equality, therefore, segregation is inherently unequal
