# Hydrolysis Reactions
---

- This reaction is kind of like the opposite of the [[Dehydration Synthesis]] reaction
- Hydrolysis reactions cleave covalent bonds
	- Polymers are hydrolyzed (broken down) into monomers
	- Covalent bonds are being broken between the monomers
	- A water molecule is hydrolyzed into subcomponents (H and OH) and each subcomponent is added to a differend monomer
