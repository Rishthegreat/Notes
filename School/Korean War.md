# Korean War
---
### Background to the War
- Korea was an independent nation for many centuries
- Very isolationist and only had contact with China and Japan
- Around 1890s, Japan shows a lot of influence and by 1910s, Japan controlled Korea
	- Very cruel treatment
- After WW2, Japan loose Korean lands
- Soviets come into Korea from the North and the US from the South
	- Agree to Divide Korea along the 38th parallel
	- Only supposed to be temporarily
		- Free elections to later unite Korea
- Kim Il-Sung was from North Korea, but grew up in China and had a lot of training in Soviet Union
	- He was appointed leader of North Korea
- Syngman Rhee was democratically elected for South Korea
- In 1948, there was supposed to be an election to unite both sides
- Rhee was more popular because Sung was not seen as from Korea
	- South elects Rhee, North does not hold elections, so Korea remains divided
- Both sides wanted to unify Korea under their own democratic or communist regime
### The War - **1950 - 1953**
- In the Summer of 1950 North Korea invades South Korea
- Take the capital of Seoul very quickly
- US does not like this
	- US does not know who is invading
		- Is it Korean troops? Chinese troops? Soviet troops?
			- What we now know is that Korea was supplying troops, Soviets were providing military troops, and Chinese would provide support if needed
- UN Mandate to restore peace in the area
	- Formal decleratin of war was required from US congress and that might have been difficult to obtain.
	- UN also provided greater international legitimacy for the military intervention, as it was pcercieved as a multilateral effort to protect a member state from aggression
- UN authorized troops (88% troops were American) to help South Korea under Douglas MacArthur
	- “United Nations Police Action”
- At first it went badly
- As American gather their forces, they get pushed back to Pusan
- Then later, South Korea is able to recapture the peninsula and both sides are again back at the 38th Parallel
	- They would encircle the enemy from the sides by attacking from sea
- MacArthur wants to take the entirely of Korea while Truman is nervous about China, but agrees
- US troops cross the 38th Parallel and take the capital of North Korean Pyongyang and appraoched the Yalu River

- In October 1950, Chinese troops under the name of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPV) crossed the Yalu River to assist North Korean armies
	- UN is outnumbered 2:1 and North Korea pushes down
	- The with reenforcements, South Korea pushed back up
- The war stabilizes at the 38th Parallel
- MacArthur wants to expand the war and declare war against China, maybe even using nuclear weapons
	- Truman disagrees as calls it a “Limited War”
	- MacArthur calls it “There is No Substitute for Victory”
		- Critizies Truman in the papers and Truman fires him
- People continue to fight at the 38th parallel and die while the lines do not move for 2 years as negotiations continue for ceasefire
- Truman continues to decline in popularity
- In July 1953,  the Armstice was signed and the credit is given to President Eisenhower
	- This was not a peace treaty, so technically, the Korean War is technically not yet over
