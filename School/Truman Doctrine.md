# Truman Doctrine
---
### Tensions in the Meditteranian
- There is a Civil War in Greece
	- Nationalist greek army vs democratic
	- Made greece very vulnerable to political influence
	- US scared that Soviets would step in
- The Soviets are putting a lot of pressure on the Turkish to give them access to a waterway to trade
	- Soviets wanted to drill for oil in Iran and wanted Iran’s support as well as a way to get that oil out
	- Wanted transit rights in the Turkish Straits as well as a military base there
- US Feared a domino effect

### Addressing the Crisis
- Truman gives a speech in 1947 where he says
	- “US should support free peoples throughout the world who were resisting takeovers by armed minorities or outside pressures…We must assist free peoples to work out their own destines in their own way”
		- The US will aid nations that are fighting against communism
- The US gave Greece and Turkey $400 Million
	- Greece does not become communism and Turkey does not give up the strait
	- Therefore, this was seen as a success and people liked that Truman was taking a hard stance
