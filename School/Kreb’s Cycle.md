# Kreb’s Cycle
---

- Pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion, where it is converted to Acetyl CoA

**Transition Reaction (Linked)**
- Investment
	- 2 pyruvate
		- Each glucose molecule produces 2 pyruvates

- Payoff
	- 2 Acetyl Coenzyme A
	- 2 NADH
	- 2 $CO_2$ (Waste product)

**Kreb’s Cycle aka Citric Cycle aka TCA cycle**

- This is all redox and coupled reactions
	- Harnessing the available energy in glucose through the bonds in order to get ATP to do work like create proteins, divide, etc
