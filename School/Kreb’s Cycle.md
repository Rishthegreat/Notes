# Kreb’s Cycle
---

- Pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion, where it is converted to Acetyl CoA

**Transition Reaction (Linked)**
- Takes place in the mitochondrial matrix
- Investment
	- 2 pyruvate
		- Each glucose molecule produces 2 pyruvates

- Payoff
	- 2 Acetyl Coenzyme A
	- 2 NADH
	- 2 $CO_2$ (Waste product)

**Kreb’s Cycle aka Citric Cycle aka TCA cycle**

- Takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria
	- Mitochondria used to be its own bacteria and it has its own DNA
	- Mitochondrial DNA comes from maternal DNA
		- mtDNA
			- DNA that was passed down to you from your mother
- This reaction is only showing 1 cycle with 1 Acetyl CoA. 1 glucose will result in 2 of these cycles because 1 glucose molecule will produce 2 Acetyl CoA
- This is all redox and coupled reactions
	- Harnessing the available energy in glucose through the bonds in order to get ATP to do work like create proteins, divide, etc
