#### Enzyme Structure 3.1
- Exergonic Reactions - Release energy by breaking chemical bonds of a large reactant and producing smaller produce
- Endergonic Reactions - Absorb energy by forming chemical bonds of smaller reactants to produce a larger product
	- Plant takes in light, water, and carbon dioxide and creates oxygen and glucose
- Coupled reaction - When an endergonic reaction is powered by an exergonic reaction
	- Production of Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP)
	- OIL RIG
		- Oxidation is less electrons, Reduction is gain electrons
- -ase suffix is enzymes (Are proteins)
