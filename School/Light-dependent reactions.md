- Plant Structure
	- Chloroplasts
		- Double membrane
		- Stromata
			- fluid-filled interior
		- Thylakoid Sacs
		- Grana Stacks
	- Thylakoid membrane contains
		- Chlorophyll molecules
		- Electron transport chain
		- ATP synthase
			- $H^+$ gradient built up within thylakoid sac

- Photosystem 2 is on the left while the photosystem 1 is on the right
	- 2 is phosphoryla
- Photolysis
	- Using light to break apart water in order to provide the electrons and oxygens needed for the entire process
		- The light energizes the electrons
	- Provides the fuel in the ETC


- Next comes the [[Calvin Cycle]] that produces glucose
