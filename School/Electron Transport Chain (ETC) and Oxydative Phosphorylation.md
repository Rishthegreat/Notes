# Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxydative Phosphorylation
---

- The goal of the ETC is to couple energy stored in electron acceptors to a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis

- The folds in the mitochondria allow for Oxidative Phosphorelation. More surface area = more area for reactions

##### Phospholipid bi-layer

- The bilayer is in water and water is polar
- If you are polar, you cannot get through the phospholipid bilayer

- Electrons that were extracted in the [[Kreb’s Cycle]] are carried by $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ to the Electron Transport Chain
- The electrons are passed from one carrier to the next until they are ultimately accepted by oxygen, forming water (Oxygen is the final electron acceptor)
- The energy from the electrons is used to pump protons into the intermembrane space, forming an elecrochemical gradient
	- Moving hydogens without electrons (basically a proton) against the concentration gradient
- Protons diffuse through ATP synthase (chemiosmosis), which uses the energy of the gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP. Thus type of ATP synthesis is called Oxydative Phosphorylation

- All the shapes are different protein complexes
- In complex 1
	- NADH gives its electrons to complex 1 and then they are given to CoQ
	- This supercharges the complex and allows hydrogen to move against the gradient
- In complex 2
	- FADH gives its electrons to complex 2 and then they are given to CoQ
- In complex 3
	- CoQ gives the electrons to complex 3
	- This supercharges the complex and allows hydrogen to move against the gradient
- In complex 4
	- Complex 4, the electrons attach themselves to oxygen which splits from O2 to 2 oygen ions and then this forms 2 water molecules

- At this point there is a massive hydrogen gradient
- ADP takes advantage of the hydrogen gradient and uses that energy to turn into ATP which has more energy that the body can use

- ETC Summary
- Investment
	- 10 $NADH$
	- 2 $FADH_2$
	- Oxygen
- Payoff
	- 28 ATP (28 to 34)
		- You need to Add the ATP from Glycolysis and ATP from the Kreb’s cycle
	- $H_2O$
