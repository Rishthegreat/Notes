REVIEW TOPICS:
- Metabolism
	- The different chemical reactions that the body undergoes
- Exergonic vs Endergonic
	- Exergonic reactions release energy while endergonic reactions need energy
	- They can be coupled so that the energy released by the exergonic reaction is used to fuel the endergonic reaction
- Enzymes
- Enzyme Structure
- enzyme-substrate complex
- Enzyme Activation/Activation Energy
- rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction
- Denaturation
- transition state
- cofactors or coenzymes
- conformation change
	- Alteration of the shape of the structure of a protein or enzyme due to changes in the environment pH level, temperature, etc and this affects the ability of the enzyme to catalyze a reaction
- lock and key model vs induced fit model
- competitive and non-competitive inhibition/allosteric inhibition
- Factors that Affect Enzyme Activity
- Acetyl- CoA
- Cellular Respiration
- Glycolysis
- Linked/Transition Reaction
- pyruvate
- Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle)
