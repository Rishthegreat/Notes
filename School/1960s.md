## Kennedy's Presidency
### The 1950s Elections
#### Nixon + Eisenhower
- Eisenhower was not really a Republican
	- The house was controlled by Democrats
- Eisenhower was a moderate Republican
	- Nixon was the big Republican
	- He became famous for his attacks on Communism
	- And his kitchen debate with Kruischevivviviv
#### Kennedy
- Background:
	- WW2 Hero
	- Rich family and popular
	- Famous family
	- Good looking
- Not the most popular
- He surprises Democrats by winning the Primary even while being unpopular
	- To politically strengthen his campaign, he had London Johnson as his VP
		- They did not like each other
		- But were politically strong each other
#### Kennedy's Campaign
- Said US needs to close the missile gap, although it wasn't true, it was not known by that public
	- So he said that after Sputnik the US was behind the Soviets in Missiles
	- The Republicans allowed this gap to happen
- He was the first Catholic to run as president
	- Al … ran in the past and it did not go well for him as a catholic
	- Said his catholicism would not affect any of his decisions
### Election of 1960s
- The first televised debate - And this played to help Kennedy win
- People who listened on the Radio thought Nixon had won
	- But People are not on the radio anymore, the television
- He talked with producers to discuss angles and where to look, tanned, wore makeup, wore specific outputs
	- This allowed him to pop out on a black and white TV - Makes him look good looking and look like a good leader
- While Nixon looked weak on the TV - Bad colors, bad knee so he was wobbly, had the flu
	- Overall looked weak
		- Corruption

○ Kennedys were very corrupt - HIs father had many mob ties

○ So he most likely bought votes in certain areas - Voter fraud

○ Nixon actually called Eisenhower to try to challenge this corruption, but Eisenhower said no, we don't do that in America

# Kennedy as President

- They had young kids
  1. Baby boom

- Called for Liberal Ideas like Truman:
  1. Increase aid to education

○ Provide health insurance to the elderly

○ Help Migrant Workers

○ Raise minimum wage

○ Clear slums, rebuild Urban Areas

- Ideas can't get through Congress - blocked by Republicans and Southern Democrats ● Why is this important?
  1. When Kennedy dies, London uses his legacy to pass Kennedy's ideas

■ Known as the Great Society

○ Says Kennedy wanted this, now you have to do this

○ A couple years after his assassination Kennedy is seen as a saint

- This is why the new frontier is important - The legacy continues in London's presidency

## Race to the Moon - Space Race in the New Frontier

- Vouched for increased funding for research and development in space and defense industries
- "Moon Landing" - 1969
  1. Speech about how Americans are going to space

○ We do not go to the moon because it is easy, we go because it is hard

- This was to help the competition against the Soviets
- And by getting to the moon first, and planting the flag on it we are asserting dominance over the Soviets

○ Promoting the US in the context of the Cold War

○ Promoting Good Will

- Popular and well received

## Alliance for Progress

● A Marshall plan for Latin America

○ Not as famous or as successful though ● All in the context of Cuba

○ When Cuba became communist, there was a fear that the surrounding nations would fall to Communism ● Program:

○ Expand economic aid to Latin America

○ Offered 20 billion in aid in exchange for democratic and capitalist reforms ● All to prevent the spread of communism

## Flexible Response

- Very Critical of Eisenhower's relations to foreign issues
- Wanted a flexible response - To expand US military options ○ Continuing to build nuclear capabilities ○ Strengthening conventional weapons:

■ Insurgency groups

- Thought that if we only had the option of Nuclear power, it would be dangerous to the world

○ So wanted flexible responses that would not cause mass destruction

# The Period of Crises

## The Bay of Pigs, April 1961

- When Communist Castro comes to Cuba, which was very close to the US, we were afraid and wanted to get rid of him
- The CIA had a plan under Eisenhower
  1. Trained over a thousand Cuban refugees in America

○ The US would land them in Cuba, and then have them spark a revolution against Castro and create Democracy/Capitalism

- Called the Bay of Pigs
  1. Since they landed in the Bay of Pigs ● Kennedy's Response

○ He approves the plan

○ But says that if the military fails, he is not going to support the war and put in American troops

○ The cuban refugee military did not believe him and thought he would support them in the war ● Results:

○ The Soviet spies in the CIA knew about the Bay of Pigs invasion

○ The Cuban refugees land and are quickly captured

○ Massive failure ● Importance:

○ Further increases US and Cuban tensions

■ And Castro gets closer and closer to Kruschev and the Soviets

■ We tried many times to assassinate him

○ Creates tensions between the military and Kennedy

■ The military felt that Kennedy cripled the invasion ● Big disaster and then Kennedy went on the TV

○ He went on TV and said that it was his failure

○ Line - Normally victory has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan

■ Everybody wants to claim the success

■ Nobody wants to claim the defeat

○ So he admitted his failure

○ And his popularity went up

## Berlin Crisis - 1961

- Kennedy and Kruschev meet in Vienna
- Kruschev is saying America must get out of Berlin ● Problem:
  1. People are leaving East Germany and going to West Germany

○ 20% of the population left

○ People are leaving these communist states ● So Krusvhev is trying to remove and prevent this

○ Since it was destroying the economy

- No American would leave
- So what does Krusvhev do: BUILDS THE BERLIN WALL
- **The Berlin Wall Goes Up (1961)**
  1. Builds a wall that divides the city into two

○ Guard the wall and enforce that nobody illegally migrate

○ And to many this is the symbol of the Cold War

○ And to many this is also the symbol of the failure of Communist

■ Shows that communism was ultimately more unpopular than capitalism since people were trying to run away from communism

Ich bin ein Berliner!

- Kennedy went to Berlin and gave a speech
- Showed his commitment to West Berlin and West Germany
- Famously ended it saying "ich bin ein Berliner" - I am also a citizen of Berlin
  1. Berliner = Jelly Donut

○ But everyone knew what he was actually trying to say

## CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
- The big crisis of this period - The closes the US ever came to war
- Once Kruschev and Castro are aligned, Kruschev decides to put in nuclear weapons in Cuba
	- The US would not allow this - They would be willing to go to war to prevent this
	- This would be a huge direct threat to the US
- U2 Spy planes revealed the missiles getting in Cuba
- Americans considered surgical airstrikes, however Kennedy finally implemented a blockade, a naval strikes
#### Results
- Khrushchev forced out and Soviets build up weapons
- Limited Test Ban Treaty: US, USSR, GB
- Hot Line established
	- Previously, all communications with each other was done through backchannels, now thre is a hot line to directly call each other
- Relations with Cuba get worse
- JFK’s popularity increases

#### Kennedy and Vietnam
- When Kennedy is president he greatly increased the number of advisors in Vietnam
	- 1961 → 700 to 1963 → 16000
		- To train and support Southern Vietnam
- Opposition against Ziem regime
	- “Strategic Hamlets”
		- Fenced in the villages
	- Buddist monks were known to set themselves on fire in opposition to Ziem
		- The people did not support the government that the US supported in South Vietnam
	- Kennedy authorizes a CIA coup to remove Ziem from power, but it goes a bit sideways and Ziem is killed
		- This happens a week before Kennedy’s assassination
	- After this, the US is really in power in Southern Vietnam

#### Election
#### Assassination
- Police report goes about a person about a person named Lee Harvey Oswald
- He is arrested from a theatre

		- Many people do not blieve this and think that there was another shooter
- In 1960s Kennedy’s became an icon of an idealistic leader
	- Since then, his legacy has been tainted
		- He cheated on his wife multiple times and the secret service helped him
		- Family had a lot of mob ties that might have helped him win the election
		- Had back pain from the war, so he probably abused prescription pain killers

- Lyndon B Johnson was a smart guy and slowly works his way up politics
	- He is a democrat and idealizes FDR
	- In texas, he could not get elected, so he acted more moderate
	- As president, his liberal ideas began to show through

		- Very conservative
		- His campagin started the moderate-conservative revival in the US
