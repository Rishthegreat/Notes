- While Nixon looked weak on the TV - Bad colors, bad knee so he was wobbly, had the flu
	- Overall looked weak
		- Corruption
- Kennedys were very corrupt
	- His father had many mob ties
	- So he most likely bought votes in certain areas - Voter fraud

		- Program:
			- Expand economic aid to Latin America
			- Offered 20 billion in aid in exchange for democratic and capitalist reforms

	- Thought that if we only had the option of Nuclear power, it would be dangerous to the world
	- So wanted flexible responses that would not cause mass destruction
### The Period of Crises
#### The Bay of Pigs, April 1961
- When Communist Castro comes to Cuba, which was very close to the US, we were afraid and wanted to get rid of him
	- The CIA had a plan under Eisenhower
	- Trained over a thousand Cuban refugees in America
		- The US would land them in Cuba, and then have them spark a revolution against Castro and create Democracy/Capitalism
- Called the Bay of Pigs
	- Since they landed in the Bay of Pigs
- Kennedy's Response
	- He approves the plan
	- But says that if the military fails, he is not going to support the war and put in American troops
	- The cuban refugee military did not believe him and thought he would support them in the war
	- Results:
		- The Soviet spies in the CIA knew about the Bay of Pigs invasion
		- The Cuban refugees land and are quickly captured
		- Massive failure
		- Further increases US and Cuban tensions
		- And Castro gets closer and closer to Kruschev and the Soviets
			- We tried many times to assassinate him
		- Creates tensions between the military and Kennedy
		- The military felt that Kennedy cripled the invasion
			- Big disaster and then Kennedy went on the TV
			- He went on TV and said that it was his failure
			- Line - Normally victory has a thousand fathers and defeat is an orphan
				- Everybody wants to claim the success
				- Nobody wants to claim the defeat
				- So he admitted his failure
				- And his popularity went up
#### Berlin Crisis - 1961
- Kennedy and Kruschev meet in Vienna
- Kruschev is saying America must get out of Berlin
	- Problem:
		- People are leaving East Germany and going to West Germany
		- 20% of the population left
		- People are leaving these communist states
			- So Krusvhev is trying to remove and prevent this
			- Since it was destroying the economy
- No American would leave
	- So what does Krusvhev do: BUILDS THE BERLIN WALL
##### The Berlin Wall Goes Up (1961)
- Builds a wall that divides the city into two
- Guard the wall and enforce that nobody illegally migrate
- And to many this is the symbol of the Cold War
	- And to many this is also the symbol of the failure of Communist
	- Shows that communism was ultimately more unpopular than capitalism since people were trying to run away from communism
###### Ich bin ein Berliner!
- Kennedy went to Berlin and gave a speech
	- Showed his commitment to West Berlin and West Germany
	- Famously ended it saying "ich bin ein Berliner" - I am also a citizen of Berlin
	- Berliner = Jelly Donut
		- But everyone knew what he was actually trying to say
#### Cuban Missle Crisis
- The big crisis of this period - The closes the US ever came to war
- Once Kruschev and Castro are aligned, Kruschev decides to put in nuclear weapons in Cuba
	- The US would not allow this - They would be willing to go to war to prevent this
	- This would be a huge direct threat to the US
- U2 Spy planes revealed the missiles getting in Cuba
