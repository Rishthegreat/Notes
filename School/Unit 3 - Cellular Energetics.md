#### Enzyme Structure 3.1
- Exergonic Reactions - Release energy by breaking chemical bonds of a large reactant and producing smaller produce
- Endergonic Reactions - Absorb energy by forming chemical bonds of smaller reactants to produce a larger product
	- Plant takes in light, water, and carbon dioxide and creates oxygen and glucose
- Coupled reaction - When an endergonic reaction is powered by an exergonic reaction
	- Production of Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP)
	- OIL RIG
		- Oxidation is less electrons, Reduction is gain electrons
- -ase suffix is enzymes (Are proteins)

#### Enzyme Catalysis 3.2
#### Environmental Impacts on Enzyme Function 3.3
#### Cellular Energy 3.4
#### Photosynthesis 3.5
#### Cellular Respiration 3.6
- Cellular respiration involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that harvest free energy from simple carbohydrates

1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. [[Kreb’s Cycle]]

$O_2$ → The final $e^-$ acceptors

#### Fitness 3.7
