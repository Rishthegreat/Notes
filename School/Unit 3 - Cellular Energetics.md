#### Enzyme Structure 3.1
- Exergonic Reactions - Release energy by breaking chemical bonds of a large reactant and producing smaller produce
- Endergonic Reactions - Absorb energy by forming chemical bonds of smaller reactants to produce a larger product
	- Plant takes in light, water, and carbon dioxide and creates oxygen and glucose
- Coupled reaction - When an endergonic reaction is powered by an exergonic reaction
	- Production of Adenosine TriPhosphate (ATP)
	- OIL RIG
		- Oxidation is less electrons, Reduction is gain electrons
- -ase suffix is enzymes (Are proteins)

#### Enzyme Catalysis 3.2
#### Environmental Impacts on Enzyme Function 3.3
#### Cellular Energy 3.4
#### Photosynthesis 3.5
#### Cellular Respiration 3.6
- Cellular respiration involves a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that harvest free energy from simple carbohydrates

3 Steps to cellular respiration with oxygen (aerobic respiration)
1. [[Glycolysis]]
2. [[Krebâ€™s Cycle]]
3. [[Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxydative Phosphorylation]]

- Total Summary
	- Investment
		- 1 Glucose
		- Oxygen
	- Payoff
		- Water
		- $CO_2$
		- 36-38 ATP
	- Yields 686 kcal energy per mole of glucose oxidized

In the absense of oxygen, ATP production can still continue. This is called fermentation
- 2 major types
	- Lactic Acid Fermentations in Animals
	- Ethanol (alcohol) Fermentation in Bacteria like yeast
