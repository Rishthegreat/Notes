---

#### Why did the Spanish-American War start?
- [[Cuba's War of Independence]]
	- The US is angry at the Spanish due to these conditions and sympathy for the Cuban cause increases
	- Thomas Jefferson and many other politicians had talked about owning Cuba because it was a great defense point for the south-eastern United States
		- US's national mythology was to stand up for freedom and side with the Cubans, but if the US wanted to own Cuba, they should have supported the Spanish suppression
		- Needs to decide which cause to support before it can move forward
	- During this time, newspapers were in competition with each other and wanted to have the most sensational, and dramatic storeis to get more readership
		- Joseph Pulitzer in NY World vs William Randolph Hearst in NY Journal
- [[Yellow Journalism]] and Jingoism
  - Romanticism to War
    - Newspapers were selling and the people wanted to fight
  - Hearst to Frederick Remington:
    - You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war
      - Just give me something and I'll make a story
