---

#### Why did the Spanish-American War start?
- [[Cuba's War of Independence]]
	- The US is angry at the Spanish due to these conditions and sympathy for the Cuban cause increases
	- Thomas Jefferson and many other politicians had talked about owning Cuba because it was a great defense point for the south-eastern United States
		- US's national mythology was to stand up for freedom and side with the Cubans, but if the US wanted to own Cuba, they should have supported the Spanish suppression
		- Needs to decide which cause to support before it can move forward
	- During this time, newspapers were in competition with each other and wanted to have the most sensational, and dramatic storeis to get more readership
		- Joseph Pulitzer in NY World vs William Randolph Hearst in NY Journal
- [[Yellow Journalism]] and Jingoism
  - Romanticism to War
    - Newspapers were selling and the people wanted to fight
  - Hearst to Frederick Remington:
    - You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war
      - Just give me something and I'll make a story

#### Causes and consequences of the War
- Encouraging involvment in the Cuban war to help the Cubans through journalism
- Dupuy de Lome, Spanish ambassador to the US
	- He critizied President McKinley as weak and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd
		- Due to this he had to resign his post and leave the country
		- People said the same thing about him, but the difference is that people did not like the Spanish saying this about the president
- February 15, 1898
	- The Maine ship was exploded, killing 260
		- The Americans then assume that The Spanish do it and there is outrage in America
			- "Remember the Maine and to Hell with Spain"
		- Yellow Journalism made this worse by exxagerating and making assumptions
		- There were 2 investigations - one done by Americans and the Spanish
			- The Spanish said that it was an internal explosion
			- The Americans said that it was an external cause
			- In 1970, the US dug out the ship and found out that Spain was correct
