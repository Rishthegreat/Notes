#### Causes of the Great Depression

##### Election of 1928

- Alfred Smith nominated by Democrats
	- He was a Catholic
		- A lot of anti-Catholic sentiment
		- People said that the pope would run the country instead of Smith
	- New Yorker, “Wet”, Colorful, Catholic
		- Wet meaning he did not like prohibition
		- People did not like how he sounded on the radio in places other then New York such as Texas
- First election where the radio played a big role
- The republicans won by a really big margin
	- Many people were excited about Hoover because he had a reputation of being a humanitarian and a good business leader
