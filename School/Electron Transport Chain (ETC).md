- The folds in the mitochondria allow for Oxidative Phosphorelation. More surface area = more area for reactions

##### Phospholipid bi-layer

- The bilayer is in water and water is polar
- If you are polar, you cannot get through the phospholipid bilayer

- Electrons that were extracted in the [[Krebâ€™s Cycle]] are carried by $NADH$ and $FADH_2$ to the Electron Transport Chain
- The electrons are passed from one carrier to the next until they are ultimately accepted by oxygen, forming water (Oxygen is the final electron acceptor)
- The energy from the electrons is used to pump protons into the intermembrane space, forming an elecrochemical gradient
	- Moving hydogens without electrons (basically a proton) against the concentration gradient
- Protons diffuse through ATP synthase (ch)
