	- Expanding US business interests in other nations
- Moral Diplomacy - Wilson
	- Consider the needs of other nations
	- Repeals Panama Canal Toll Act of 1912
		- America did nto have to pay tolls, but other nations did
			- Other nations did not like this and Wilson did not either, so he repealed it
	- Philippines - 1916
		- Granted territorial status
		- Added Bill of Rights to the Philippine Constitution and added made suffrage
		- And "promised" independence
			- Never stated when
	- Puerto Rico 1917 (Went over this in Imperialism Unit - [[Unit 7 (1890 - 1945)]])
		- Granted US citizenship to all inhabitants

- However, sometimes, Wilson did act like Roosevelt and Taft

	- Dominic Republic - Marines in 1916
	- Virgin Islands - 1917
		- Purchased from Denmark
		- Still owned today

- America was very close to war with Mexico prior to WW1
	- [[Crisis in Mexico]]

#### Causes of War
- Rising tensions in Europe in 1914 a result of 4 main long term causes
	- Imperialism
		- Set up natural rivalries
		- [[Scramble for Africa]]
	- Militarism
		- All these countries had long standing large armies
			- US did not have this
	- Nationalism
		- Pride and power of nations
			- Superiority
		- Nation of Germany was formed in the 1870s
			- Germanic people were around for a long time, but they formed a new nation
		- Italy was founded
			- Italians were around since the Romans
		- Nations should be based upon ethnicities
			- Germans should be with Germans, etc
	- Alliances
		- There were a lot of wars in Europe and European nations thought that alliances would prevent it
			- I dont wanna fight you because you are allied with this other nation
			- Triple Antente (Becomes Allied Powers)
				- France, Great Britain, and Russia
			- Triple Alliance (Becomes Central Powers)
				- Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
- The Austria-Hungary Empire ruled over many differed people of different nations
- Bosnia had many ethnic Serbians
- Nation of Serbia (Not part of Austria-Hungary)
	- Carved out of the old-fading empire of the Ottoman Empire
	- New Nations
- Great nationalistic tensions in the Balkans in Serbia
- They wanted to combine into one into Yukoslavia
	- Serbian leaders want independence from Austria-Hungary for Bosnia-Herzegovina
- Heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary (The Archduke) was visiting Serbia for a speech
- The Black Hand terrorist organization to create a "Greater Serbia"
	- Mostly made of teenagers
- Serbian teenager Gavrilo Princip assasinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary
	- Also killed his wife

- This kicks in a domino effect of alliances leading to the War
	- Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia
	- Russia, protector of the Slavs, begins to mobilize, declares war on Austria
	- Germany, Austria's ally declares war on Russia and France
		- Germany had been planning for this potential war for decades
- Russia does not have a standing army so it would take a long time
- France was heavily fortified
	- Germany had a plan to go through neutral Belgium
		- The Schlieffen plan
	- This causes the British to join the War

- Allied Powers - France, Great Britain, Russia
- Central Powers - German Empire, Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire
	- Italians join the the War a year later siding with the Allied Powers
- Most of the fighting happens on the Western Front
	- Some on the Western Front
- This was truly the world's first global war
- Germany almost takes France and Paris
	- But the French hold and this results in a stalemate for 3-4 years
		- Brutal fighting and not going anywhere

#### United States
- US does not want to enter the War and Wilson says that the US is neutral
- The problem was that many people in the United States had some relations with the foreign nations
	- Many were immigrants
	- They would root for certain sides
- Naturally, the United States would have supported the Allied Powers because there were more cultural connections
- There is a lot of British media in the United States
	- Exxagerated through the [[Yellow Journalism]] painting the Germans as evil for invading the Belgiums
	- Atrocities commited in Beligium like the raping of women
- Wilson was worried that the the opinions, divisions, and journalism would result in America getting dragged into the war and he gave a speech on August 19, 1914 (Wilson's Statement of Neutrality)
- Since the US was neutral, it could trade with both sides and this resulted in a boom for the economy, due to increased food production and manufacturing
- Why does US trade more with the allies
	- The US favors the allies, but the main reason is because American ships cannot get to Germany and the British have a successful blockade on Germany (it is also a significant reason why the Germans lost the War). Many starved to death.
- Germany did not have a strong navy, but it had submaries that it invested in
	- This resulted in a maritime warfare, disrupting US trade interests
