- Big Stick Diplomacy - Roosevelt
- Dollar Diplomacy - Taft
	- Expanding US business interests in other nations
- Moral Diplomacy - Wilson
	- Consider the needs of other nations
	- Repeals Panama Canal Toll Act of 1912
		- America did nto have to pay tolls, but other nations did
			- Other nations did not like this and Wilson did not either, so he repealed it
	- Philippines - 1916
		- Granted territorial status
		- Added Bill of Rights to the Philippine Constitution and added made suffrage
		- And "promised" independence
			- Never stated when
	- Puerto Rico 1917 (Went over this in Imperialism Unit - [[Unit 7 (1890 - 1945)]])
		- Granted US citizenship to all inhabitants

- However, sometimes, Wilson did act like Roosevelt and Taft
- Wilson's Military Interventions
	- Haiti - Marines in 1915
	- Dominic Republic - Marines in 1916
	- Virgin Islands - 1917
		- Purchased from Denmark
		- Still owned today

- America was very close to war with Mexico prior to WW1
	- [[Crisis in Mexico]]

#### Causes of War
- Rising tensions in Europe in 1914 a result of 4 main long term causes
	- Imperialism
		- Set up natural rivalries
		- [[Scramble for Africa]]
	- Militarism
		- All these countries had long standing large armies
			- US did not have this
	- Nationalism
		- Pride and power of nations
			- Superiority
		- Nation of Germany was formed in the 1870s
			- Germanic people were around for a long time, but they formed a new nation
		- Italy was founded
			- Italians were around since the Romans
		- Nations should be based upon ethnicities
			- Germans should be with Germans, etc
	- Alliances
		- There were a lot of wars in Europe and European nations thought that alliances would prevent it
			- I dont wanna fight you because you are allied with this other nation
			- Triple Antente (Becomes Allied Powers)
				- France, Great Britain, and Russia
			- Triple Alliance (Becomes Central Powers)
				- Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
- The Austria-Hungary Empire ruled over many differed people of different nations
- Bosnia had many ethnic Serbians
- Nation of Serbia (Not part of Austria-Hungary)
	- Carved out of the old-fading empire of the Ottoman Empire
	- New Nations
- Great nationalistic tensions in the Balkans in Serbia
- They wanted to combine into one into Yukoslavia
	- Serbian leaders want independence from Austria-Hungary for Bosnia-Herzegovina
- Heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary (The Archduke) was visiting Serbia for a speech
- The Black Hand terrorist organization to create a "Greater Serbia"
	- Mostly made of teenagers
- Serbian teenager Gavrilo Princip assasinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary
	- Also killed his wife

- This kicks in a domino effect of alliances leading to the War
	- Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia
	- Russia, protector of the Slavs, begins to mobilize, declares war on Austria
	- Germany, Austria's ally declares war on Russia and France
		- Germany had been planning for this potential war for decades
- Russia does not have a standing army so it would take a long time
- France was heavily fortified
	- Germany had a plan to go through neutral Belgium
		- The Schlieffen plan
	- This causes the British to join the War

- Allied Powers - France, Great Britain, Russia
- Central Powers - German Empire, Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire
	- Italians join the the War a year later siding with the Allied Powers
- Most of the fighting happens on the Western Front
	- Some on the Western Front
- This was truly the world's first global war
- Germany almost takes France and Paris
	- But the French hold and this results in a stalemate for 3-4 years
		- Brutal fighting and not going anywhere

#### United States's Involvement in the War
- US does not want to enter the War and Wilson says that the US is neutral
- The problem was that many people in the United States had some relations with the foreign nations
	- Many were immigrants
	- They would root for certain sides
- Naturally, the United States would have supported the Allied Powers because there were more cultural connections
- There is a lot of British media in the United States
	- Exxagerated through the [[Yellow Journalism]] painting the Germans as evil for invading the Belgiums
	- Atrocities commited in Beligium like the raping of women
- Wilson was worried that the the opinions, divisions, and journalism would result in America getting dragged into the war and he gave a speech on August 19, 1914 (Wilson's Statement of Neutrality)
- Since the US was neutral, it could trade with both sides and this resulted in a boom for the economy, due to increased food production and manufacturing
- Why does US trade more with the allies
	- The US favors the allies, but the main reason is because American ships cannot get to Germany and the British have a successful blockade on Germany (it is also a significant reason why the Germans lost the War). Many starved to death.
- Germany did not have a strong navy, but it had submaries that it invested in
	- This resulted in a maritime warfare, disrupting US trade interests
		- US ships were also sunk
	- US was not happy at British because the British's blockage would result in British confiscation of supplies, but no deaths
		- Forced Americans ashore (Not killed)
	- However, US was even more mad because the Germans were killing Americans
		- This is going to be a main reason that America enters the War on the Allied side

### US Army
- The US did not have a long standing army
	- US needed a draft and the last draft was during the Civil War and it was pretty bad
	- 1917 - Selective Service Act
		- All men between 21 and 30 register (later changed to 18 and 45)
		- 24 million men registered for the draft by the end of 1918
		- 8 million men served in WW1 (2 million saw active combat)
			- 2.8 million drafted
			- 2 million volunteered
	- They were called the American Expeditionary

#### America on the Homefront
- The Citizens of the country are usually impacted and ask more of their citizens during times of crisis
- WW1 is mostly popular, but a minority (mid-western dems, socialists, and immigrants) do not support war
- During WW1, governmnet is very involved in private business and create a lot of agencies for the War
	- Council of National Defense
		- War Industries Board - Bernard Baruch
			- Regulates all war material
			- Control over raw materials and prices
			- Increases Production by 20%
				- Considered successful
				- Creative ways to ask for donations
					- One way was to ask gradles from women to use the steel to make battleships
		- Food Administration - Herbert Hoover
			- Hoover became popular because at the start of the war he raised money for the starving belgium citizens
			- Meatless Tuesdays, Wheatless Wednesdays
			- Victory Gardens

			- Lever Act
				- Government can set prices of certain commodities
			- There were many political cartoons asking people to make some sacrifices so that food can be conserved and sent abroad
		- Fuel Administration - Harry Garfield

		- US Railroad Administration - William McAdoo
			- During the War, the government was controlling the railroads
	- US Shipping Board
		- A lot of posters promoting workers since 5 million men are abroad fighting the war
	- The private companies were making a lot of money, so they did not complain too much about the increased regulation

##### Financing the War
- The war is very expensive
	- The way the government does this is through Bonds
- Liberty Bond Drive (21 Billion)
	- Average American lent war effort $400
- Raised personal income taxes on wealthy Americans and excise tax on luxury items
- Government reaised 33 Bil in 2 years

##### Result of this Greater Control
- Unemployment virtually disappeared
	- More workers needed
	- Many worked more than 1 job
- Expansion of the "big government"
	- Excessive governmnet regulations in the economy
	- This is the largest we see the US government uptil this point in US history
- Close cooperation between public and private sectors
	- They tolerated this because they were making more money
	- This is an early example of massive production due to the capitalist nature of US economy
		- We see this more prominent during [[WW2]]
- Unprecedented opportunities for disadvantaged groups
	- Opportunities for Women
		- Certain women like Jane Addams and some groups opposed the War, but many remained loyal and supported it
		- 1 million women worked in war industries
		- Woodrow Wilson was initially against women working, but when he saw that most were supportive and they could work, he championed women suffrage
		- This became a point in history where women became a big part of nurses
			- Nurses were the most common job women had
			- Many joined in the Red Cross
		- The
