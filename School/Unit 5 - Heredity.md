## Meiosis 5.1
### Karyotypes
- The X chromosomes come from the egg while from the sperm, it can either be another X chromosome or a Y chromosome
	- This is the sex chromosome, one of the 23 pairs
	- The Y chromosome has much less genetic information than the X chromosome
- Homologous chromosomes
	- Chromosomes from different parents, but contain some types of genes in same location
- A particular location on a particular chromosome is called a loci
	- AKA a particular gene file
#### Reading Karyotypes
- Ensure that there are 46 chromosomes
	- **Monosomy**
		- Having only one chromosome in a homologous pair
	- **Trisomy** (Down syndrome)
		- Having 3 homologous chromosomes
		- Non-disjunction
			- When a pair of similar chromosomes does not split up because the spindle makes a mistake, so both chromosomes move rather than just 1
- Ensure that the lengths of the chromosomes are correct

- Crossover happens in miosis, but not in mitosis
- Tetrad â†’
	- 4 chromatids line up
	- During synapsis (When the 4 chromatids are close together)
		- Then some information gets swapped
