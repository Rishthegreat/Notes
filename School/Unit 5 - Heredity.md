## Meiosis and Genetic Diversity 5.2

## Mendelian Genetics 5.3
- It assumes that the alleles or genes (he called them factors because DNA was not discovered yet) are on separate chromosomes → non-linked
	- During the discovery, Mendel got lucky by choosing 7 genes that were on different chromosomes
- Phenotype
	- Physical appearance like purple, short, white, etc
- Genotype
	- The genetic component like homozygous dominant, heterozygous, etc
## Non-Mendelian Genetics 5.4
- A vast majority of traits are not inherited in the traditional Mendelian way
- **Major Non-Mendelian Inheritance Patterns**
	- Codominance
		- Both alleles are dominant and both are expressed
		- Example → if the hair color is codominant in cows, then a brown cow crossed with a white cow ends in a spotted cow
		- Uppercase letter for both alleles
	- Incomplete dominance
		- Neither allele is dominant
		- For example, if flower color is incompletely dominant, then a red color flower crossed with white flowers lead to a flower with a blend of both
	- Multiple Alleles
		- Many genes exist in multiple forms and are said to have multiple alleles
		- Alleles are written as a small superscript in the upper right hand co
	- Sex-linked traits
