# Reproductive Isolation
---
- In order for speciation to occur, there needs to be something that prevents populations from interbreeding - a reproductive barrier
- If two groups are in reproductive isolation, the differences between their alleles and genes can diverge through repeated cycles of mutation and Natural Selection

#### Types of Reproductive Barriers
- Geography
- Behavior
	- Difference in mating behavior, in mating calls/songs
- Timing
	- Differing timings for when the groups mate
- Anatomy
	- Different methods of reproduction
	- Different pollinators using different methods to polinize a plant (example)
- Genetic incompatibility
	- Difference in sex cells, number of chromosomes, etc

- Reproductive isolations causes lineages to branch
- Mutation and allele shuffling generate varation within each branch
- Natural selection causes those bracnhes to diverge as each population adapts to different surroundings
- This pattern, when repeated many times cause cause a single bracnh to expand into millions over time
