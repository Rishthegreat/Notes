#### Derivative of inverse of $f(x)$
$\frac{d}{dx}[f^{-1}(b) =$

#### Linear Approximation
![[BC Q1 2022-11-01 15.43.04.excalidraw]]
- $f(a)$ has to be easy to calculate
- $x$ has to be close to $a$
- $L$ is the linearization of $f$ centered at $x=a$
	- $L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$
- $\Delta f \approx f'(a)\Delta x$  â†’ estimating the change in $f$
