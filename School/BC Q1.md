#### Derivative of inverse of $f(x)$
$\frac{d}{dx}[f^{-1}(b)] = \frac{1}{f'(a)}$ where $f(a)=b$

#### Linear Approximation
![[BC Q1 2022-11-01 15.43.04.excalidraw]]
- $f(a)$ has to be easy to calculate
- $x$ has to be close to $a$
- $L$ is the linearization of $f$ centered at $x=a$
	- $L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$
- $\Delta f \approx f'(a)\Delta x$  â†’ estimating the change in $f$


- First derivative test if for finding local extremes of $f(x)$
- The second derivative test is for finding local extremes of $f(x)$
	- 1st and 2nd used to find the same thing, just different methods
	- ![[BC Q1 2022-11-07 22.37.39.excalidraw]]
		- $f'(c1)=0$ and $f''(c1) < 0$
			- When second derivative is less than 0, it is concave down
- The concavity test is for finding interval of concavity of f(x)
	- f is concave up on (a, b) because $f''(x) > 0$ ($f'(x)$ is increasing on this interval)
- The point of inflection test is for finding points of inflections
	- f has a point of inflection x=c because $f''(x)$ changes sign at x=c
