### Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding 1.1
- Need to look at the chemistry of water to see why it is important for life
![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 11.27.01.excalidraw]]
- The oxygen side of the “shared electron” pulls more on the electron and this causes the oxygen side to be more negatively charged
	- Oxygen and Hydrogen have a big electronegatively gap
- Hydrophillic
	- Water loving
	- Polar
- Hydrophobic
	- Not water loving
	- Non-polar

##### Properties
- Cohesion/Adhesion
	- Between water molecules
	- Between water molecules and other surfaces
	- Examples
		- How does water get to the leaves of a tall tree from a root?
			- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 12.11.35.excalidraw]]
			- It is like a conveyer belt that travels from the roots to the leaves.
- Unique Density
	- Less dense as a solid
- Biological Solvent
	- Dissociation/ionization of materials
- High Specific Heat
	- Resistant to temperature change

### Elements of Life 1.2
- Living systems require a constant input of energy because they need energy to grow, reproduce, and mantain organization
- Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
- Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules such as Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, and Lipids
	- Carbon is used for all
	- Nitrogen is used to build proteins and nucleic acids
	- Phosphorous is used to build nucleic acids and certain lipids
- Carbon can bond to other carbon atoms creating carbon skeletons to which other atoms attach
	- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-17 20.20.43.excalidraw]]
	- Skeletons allow for the creation of very large and complex molecules
	- Can be used to store energy
	- Can be used to form basic cell structure

### Introduction to Biological Macromolecules 1.3
- Monomers are chemical subunits used to create polymers
	- Polymers are macromolecules made of many monomers
	- A covalent bond is used to connect monomers
	- Monomers have specific chemical properties that allow them to interact with one another
	- Polymers are specific to the monomers they consist of
- Complex carbs are just glucose attached to glucose, etc\
- 1 is monomer
- 2 is dimer
- 3 or more is polymer
| Monomer                      | Polymer      | Bonds to combine                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Monosaccharide (eg: glucose) | Carbohydrate | For right now, it is a covalent bond |
| Amino Acid                   | Protein      | Peptide bonds                        |
| Nucleotide                   | Nucleic Acid |                                      |
| Fatty Acid                   | Lipids       |                                      |
- 2 Key reactions
	- [[Dehydration Synthesis]]
	- [[Hydrolysis Reactions]]

### Properties of Biological Macromolecules 1.4
- The linear sequence of all nucleuc acids is characterized by a 3’ hydroxyl and 5’ phosphate of the sugar in the nucleotide
