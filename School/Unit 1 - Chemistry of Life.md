### Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding 1.1

### Elements of Life 1.2
- Living systems require a constant input of energy because they need energy to grow, reproduce, and mantain organization
- Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
- Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules such as Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, and Lipids
	- Carbon is used for all
	- Nitrogen is used to build proteins and nucleic acids
	- Phosphorous is used to build nucleic acids and certain lipids
- Carbon can bond to other carbon atoms creating carbon skeletons to which other atoms attach
	- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-17 20.20.43.excalidraw]]
	- Skeletons allow for the creation of very large and complex molecules
	- Can be used to store energy
	- Can be used to form basic cell structure

### Introduction to Biological Macromolecules 1.3
- Monomers are chemical subunits used to create polymers
	- Polymers are macromolecules made of many monomers
	- A covalent bond is used to connect monomers
	- Monomers have specific chemical properties that allow them to interact with one another
	- Polymers are specific to the monomers they consist of
