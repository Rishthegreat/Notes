### Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding 1.1

### Elements of Life 1.2
- Living systems require a constant input of energy because they need energy to grow, reproduce, and mantain organization
- Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
- Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules such as Carbohydrates, Rpteins, Nucleic Acids, and Lipids
	- Carbon is used for all
	- Nitrogen is used to build proteins and nucleic acids
	- Phosphorous is used to build nucleic acids and certain lipids
- Carbon can bond to other carbon atoms creating carbon skeletons to which other atoms attach
