### Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding 1.1
- Need to look at the chemistry of water to see why it is important for life
![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 11.27.01.excalidraw|325]]
- The oxygen side of the “shared electron” pulls more on the electron and this causes the oxygen side to be more negatively charged
	- Oxygen and Hydrogen have a big electronegatively gap
- Hydrophillic
	- Water loving
	- Polar
- Hydrophobic
	- Not water loving
	- Non-polar

##### Properties
- Cohesion/Adhesion
	- Between water molecules
	- Between water molecules and other surfaces
	- Examples
		- How does water get to the leaves of a tall tree from a root?
			- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 12.11.35.excalidraw|225]]
			- It is like a conveyer belt that travels from the roots to the leaves.
- Unique Density
	- Less dense as a solid
- Biological Solvent
	- Dissociation/ionization of materials
- High Specific Heat
	- Resistant to temperature change

### Elements of Life 1.2
- Living systems require a constant input of energy because they need energy to grow, reproduce, and mantain organization
- Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
- Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules such as Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, and Lipids
	- Carbon is used for all
	- Nitrogen is used to build proteins and nucleic acids
	- Phosphorous is used to build nucleic acids and certain lipids
- Carbon can bond to other carbon atoms creating carbon skeletons to which other atoms attach
	- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-17 20.20.43.excalidraw|350]]
	- Skeletons allow for the creation of very large and complex molecules
	- Can be used to store energy
	- Can be used to form basic cell structure

### Introduction to Biological Macromolecules 1.3
- Monomers are chemical subunits used to create polymers
	- Polymers are macromolecules made of many monomers
	- A covalent bond is used to connect monomers
	- Monomers have specific chemical properties that allow them to interact with one another
	- Polymers are specific to the monomers they consist of
- Complex carbs are just glucose attached to glucose, etc\
- 1 is monomer
- 2 is dimer
- 3 or more is polymer

| Monomer                      | Polymer      | Bonds to combine                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Monosaccharide (eg: glucose) | Carbohydrate | For right now, it is a covalent bond |
| Amino Acid                   | Protein      | Peptide bonds                        |
| Nucleotide                   | Nucleic Acid |                                      |
| Fatty Acid                   | Lipids       |                                      |
- 2 Key reactions
	- [[Dehydration Synthesis]]
	- [[Hydrolysis Reactions]]

### Properties of Biological Macromolecules 1.4


### Structure and Function of Biological Macromolecules 1.5

#### Nucleotides
- The linear sequence of all nucleuc acids is characterized by a 3’ hydroxyl and 5’ phosphate of the sugar in the nucleotide
- ![[Pasted image 20221206195841.png|400]]
	- DNA is a nucleic acid polymer containing two strands, each strand in an antiparallel 5’-3’ direction
	- Adenine-Thymine base pairs are held together by 2 hydrogen bonds and Guanine-Cytosine are held together by 3
		- The more bonds in total, between the molecules, the more stable it is

- ![[Pasted image 20221206200445.png|425]]
	- The linear squence of nucleotides encodes biological information
- When synthesizing nucleic acid polymers, nucleotides can only be added to the 3’ end
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206200654.png|350]]

#### Amino Acids
- Proteins comprise linear chains of amino acids that ave directionality with an amino terminus and a carboxyl terminus
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206201457.png|300]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206201519.png|375]]
	- Amino acids are connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl terminus of the growing peptide chain

##### How the Protein Folds
- 4 elements of Protein Structure

| Structure            | Image                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Structure    | ![[Pasted image 20221206202026.png\|150]] | Structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids held together by covalend bonds, called peptide bonds. Proteins are not functional at this level and aditional folding is needed                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Secondary Structure  | ![[Pasted image 20221206202222.png\|150]] | Structure arises through local folding of the amino acid chain into elements such as alpha-helices and beta sheets. Beta sheet folding is folding in a zig-zag while alpha helices folding is in a spiral. Even here, more folding is required for it to be functional                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Tertiary Structure   | ![[Pasted image 20221206202345.png\|150]] | Structure is the overall 3D shape of the protein and often minimizes free energy. More stable level of structure for protein and many will fucntion at this level. Various types of bonds and interactions stabilize the protein at this level, paticularly with the R-groups of the amino acid that could vary in chemical properties based on the side chains that are linked there |
| Quaternary Structure | ![[Pasted image 20221206202709.png\|150]] | Some proteins require a 4th level of structure. This strucutre arises from the interaction between multiple polypeptide units. Here, there are 3 whole polypeptide chains working together. Hemoglobin is an example of a protein that reaches this structure (found in red blood cell to help transport oxygen)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

- Red beads are non polar because they have non polar R groups and blue beads are polar because they have polar R groups
- Primary
	- ![[Pasted image 20221207104153.png|250]]
- Secondary
	- ![[Pasted image 20221207105017.png|250]]
- Tertiary
	- Assume that there is some water in the surrounding areas of the protein
	- Red beads, being non polar would want to fold towards the core of the protein
	- Blue beads, being hydrophillic would want to fold towards the core, but on the outside so it can interact with water
	- ![[Pasted image 20221207105453.png|200]]
		- Let us assume that this is a receptor protein
			- Responsible for receiving chemical signals
			- The signal molecule must have a similar structure as the receptor protein in order to connect
			- ![[Pasted image 20221207110018.png|175]]
- Quartinary
	- ![[Pasted image 20221207105558.png|200]]
	- Multiple polypeptide chains

#### Carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates are made up of linear chains of sugar monomers connected by covalent bonds
- ![[Pasted image 20221207110819.png|125]]
	- The small direction change in this molecule can result in functional differences
		- When alpha glucose are joined, they form starch
		- When beta glucose are joined, then cellulose is formed
			- Used for structural support in plants
		- ![[Pasted image 20221207111047.png|225]]
			- Here, even the covalent bond has a different orientation
- Carbohydrate polymers can be linear or branched
	- ![[Pasted image 20221207111216.png|325]]
		- Starch and glycogen both function in energy storage (starch in plants and glycogen in humans and other vertebrates)
			- One thing to keep note of is that sometimes starch is found linear chains rather than branched
		- Cellulose provides strength to plant cell wall


### Nucleic Acids 1.6

- Similarities between DNA and RNA
- ![[Pasted image 20221208211942.png|400]]
	- Both are assembled from nuclieotide subunits which are comprised of a 
		- 5 carbon sugar
		- Phosphate group
		- Nitrogenous base
	- Each nucleotide monomer is connected by covalent bonds forming the sugar-phosphate backbone
	- Each linear strand of nucleotides has a 5’ end and a 3’ end
	- The nitrogenous bases are perpendicular to the sugar-phosphate backbone

- Differences
	- ![[Pasted image 20221208212059.png|375]]
	- DNA contains deoxyribose sugar while RNA contains ribose sugar
	-
