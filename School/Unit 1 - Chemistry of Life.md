### Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding 1.1
- Need to look at the chemistry of water to see why it is important for life
![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 11.27.01.excalidraw|325]]
- The oxygen side of the “shared electron” pulls more on the electron and this causes the oxygen side to be more negatively charged
	- Oxygen and Hydrogen have a big electronegatively gap
- Hydrophillic
	- Water loving
	- Polar
- Hydrophobic
	- Not water loving
	- Non-polar

##### Properties
- Cohesion/Adhesion
	- Between water molecules
	- Between water molecules and other surfaces
	- Examples
		- How does water get to the leaves of a tall tree from a root?
			- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-29 12.11.35.excalidraw|225]]
			- It is like a conveyer belt that travels from the roots to the leaves.
- Unique Density
	- Less dense as a solid
- Biological Solvent
	- Dissociation/ionization of materials
- High Specific Heat
	- Resistant to temperature change

### Elements of Life 1.2
- Living systems require a constant input of energy because they need energy to grow, reproduce, and mantain organization
- Living systems mainly use the energy stored in chemical bonds
- Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules such as Carbohydrates, Proteins, Nucleic Acids, and Lipids
	- Carbon is used for all
	- Nitrogen is used to build proteins and nucleic acids
	- Phosphorous is used to build nucleic acids and certain lipids
- Carbon can bond to other carbon atoms creating carbon skeletons to which other atoms attach
	- ![[Unit 1 - Chemistry of Life 2022-11-17 20.20.43.excalidraw|350]]
	- Skeletons allow for the creation of very large and complex molecules
	- Can be used to store energy
	- Can be used to form basic cell structure

### Introduction to Biological Macromolecules 1.3
- Monomers are chemical subunits used to create polymers
	- Polymers are macromolecules made of many monomers
	- A covalent bond is used to connect monomers
	- Monomers have specific chemical properties that allow them to interact with one another
	- Polymers are specific to the monomers they consist of
- Complex carbs are just glucose attached to glucose, etc\
- 1 is monomer
- 2 is dimer
- 3 or more is polymer

| Monomer                      | Polymer      | Bonds to combine                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Monosaccharide (eg: glucose) | Carbohydrate | For right now, it is a covalent bond |
| Amino Acid                   | Protein      | Peptide bonds                        |
| Nucleotide                   | Nucleic Acid |                                      |
| Fatty Acid                   | Lipids       |                                      |
- 2 Key reactions
	- [[Dehydration Synthesis]]
	- [[Hydrolysis Reactions]]

### Properties of Biological Macromolecules 1.4


### Structure and Function of Biological Macromolecules 1.5

#### Nucleotides
- The linear sequence of all nucleuc acids is characterized by a 3’ hydroxyl and 5’ phosphate of the sugar in the nucleotide
- ![[Pasted image 20221206195841.png|400]]
	- DNA is a nucleic acid polymer containing two strands, each strand in an antiparallel 5’-3’ direction
	- Adenine-Thymine base pairs are held together by 2 hydrogen bonds and Guanine-Cytosine are held together by 3
		- The more bonds in total, between the molecules, the more stable it is

- ![[Pasted image 20221206200445.png|425]]
	- The linear squence of nucleotides encodes biological information
- When synthesizing nucleic acid polymers, nucleotides can only be added to the 3’ end
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206200654.png|350]]

#### Amino Acids
- Proteins comprise linear chains of amino acids that ave directionality with an amino terminus and a carboxyl terminus
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206201457.png|300]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20221206201519.png|375]]
	- Amino acids are connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl terminus of the growing peptide chain

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Structure    | ![[Pasted image 20221206202026.png\|200]] | Structure is determined by the sequence of amino acids held together by covalend bonds, called peptide bonds. Proteins are not functional at this level and aditional folding is needed                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Secondary Structure  | ![[Pasted image 20221206202222.png\|175]] | Structure arises through local folding of the amino acid chain into elements such as alpha-helices and beta sheets. Even here, more folding is required for it to be functional                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Tertiary Structure   | ![[Pasted image 20221206202345.png\|175]] | Structure is the overall 3D shape of the protein and often minimizes free energy. More stable level of structure for protein and many will fucntion at this level. Various types of bonds and interactions stabilize the protein at this level, paticularly with the R-groups of the amino acid that could vary in chemical properties based on the side chains that are linked there |
| Quaternary Structure | ![[Pasted image 20221206202709.png\|175]] | Some proteins require a 4th level of structure. This strucutre arises from the interaction between multiple polypeptide units. Here, there are 3 whole polypeptide chains working together. Hemoglobin is an example of a protein that reaches this structure (found in red blood cell to help transport oxygen)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
