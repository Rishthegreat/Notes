### The First Red Scare (1919-1920)
- In 1919, there is a lot of unrest after the war
	- High inflation
	- Labor strikes
- The Bolshevik revolution in Russia causes fear in Americans about radical socialist groups
	- The Red Scare is about how Americans feared that the radical socialists would try to take over the US
- Due to this, many American citizens were deported to Russia due to fear of them being radical and connects to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
- There was a famous bombing of 1920 in Wall Street and still to this day, it is unknown who orchestrated this
	- Radical acts like this fuels this fear sentiment
- There is also a lot of anti-unionism as unions were again started to be seen as radical with their strikes, etc

#### Anti Immigrant Sentiment
- Sacco and Vanzetti
	- On April 15, 1920, a paymaster for a shoe company in South Braintree, Massachusetts, was shot and killed along with his guard. The murderers, who were described as two Italian men, escaped with more than $15,000. After going to a garage to claim a car that police said was connected with the crime, Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested and charged with the crime. Although both men carried guns and made false statements upon their arrest, neither had a previous criminal record. On July 14, 1921, they were convicted and sentenced to die.
	- During the next few years, sporadic protests were held in Massachusetts and around the world calling for their release, especially after Celestino Madeiros, then under a sentence for murder, confessed in 1925 that he had participated in the crime with the Joe Morelli gang. The state Supreme Court refused to upset the verdict, and Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller denied the men clemency. In the days leading up to the execution, protests were held in cities around the world, and bombs were set off in New York City and Philadelphia. On August 23, Sacco and Vanzetti were electrocuted.
	- In 1961, a test of Sacco’s gun using modern forensic techniques apparently proved it was his gun that killed the guard, though little evidence has been found to substantiate Vanzetti’s guilt. In 1977, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation vindicating Sacco and Vanzetti, stating that they had been treated unjustly and that no stigma should be associated with their names.
- Throughout American history with the exception of the Chinese Immigration Act, immigrants were free to come to the US
- During WW1, no immigrants were allowed to come to the US
- After WW1, there was a big influx of Immigrants and this caused a backlash against immigrants and this is reflected in the immigrants laws that follow
	- Emergency Quota Act of 1921
		- 3% of a specific nationality could come to the US
			- Using the Censur of 1910
	- National Origins Act (Immigration Act of 1924)
		- 2% of a specific nationality could come to the US
			- Using the 1890 census
			- This limited Asian immigrants
	- During this time period, North and Central America had no restrictions
		- Mexican migrants helped the economy

- Revival of the KKK
	- 1915 to 1920
	- anti-socialist, anti-catholic, pro-prohibition
	- Had a lot of members
	- Controlled politics because you could not get positions in office without being a member of the KKK
	- The Birth of a Nation
		- Very racist, but popular film at that time
			- Woodrow Wilson had a private screning of this in the white house and he said that he really liked the movies
			- Africans were shown to be unable to control their sexual desire with white women and in the movie, the KKK “saved” the day
	- It died down because there were reports that the KKK was very corrupt
	- DC Stephenson
		- Leader of the Klan
		- Prominent figure in Indiana politics
		- He ate a woman 
			- cannabalism
		- This also contribution to the Klan losing popularity

#### Race Riots of 1919
- This is called the Race Summer of Hate due to the enormous amount of racial violence during this time period
- Most famous one in Chicago

#### Rural vs Urban life
- Now more people start to live in urban areas than rural areas
- Historically, cities have tended to be more liberal with more opportunities for other minorites, sexes, and races
- As transportation and cars started to get better, we see a little bit of the growth of suburbs
- Large number of African Americans start moving in to the cities
- Many rural areas feel that their ideas are under attack (They were fundamentalist)
	- They are conservative and have a restricted view of the bible
	- They do not like the fact that schools in cities are teaching science
		- They did not like Darwinism and evolution
			- “Bible Belts” led a big push to stop the teaching of Darwin’s theory of evolution
				- Some states actually banned this teaching and most of them were Southern
		- American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
			- They convinced a teacher, John T. Scopes to break the law and teach evolution
			- He was arrested and the Monkey trial became very famous
				- Clarence Darrow was defending Scopes
				- William Jennings Bryan came on in as an expert on the bible
					- Darrow made him look foolish
					- He dies 5 days after the trial due to the stress during the trial
				- Overall, the liberal won the battle of the media and the public arena
	- They believed that cities were corrupt
	- So, they had preachers who went on the radio to preach about this
