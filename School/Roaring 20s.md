#### The First Red Scare (1919-1920)
- In 1919, there is a lot of unrest after the war
	- High inflation
	- Labor strikes
- The Bolshevik revolution in Russia causes fear in Americans about radical socialist groups
	- The Red Scare is about how Americans feared that the radical socialists would try to take over the US
- Due to this, many American citizens were deported to Russia due to fear of them being radical and connects to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)
- There was a famous bombing of 1920 in Wall Street and still to this day, it is unknown who orchestrated this
	- Radical acts like this fuels this fear sentiment
- There is also a lot of anti-unionism as unions were again started to be seen as radical with their strikes, etc

##### Anti Immigrant Sentiment
- Sacco and Vanzetti
	- On April 15, 1920, a paymaster for a shoe company in South Braintree, Massachusetts, was shot and killed along with his guard. The murderers, who were described as two Italian men, escaped with more than $15,000. After going to a garage to claim a car that police said was connected with the crime, Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested and charged with the crime. Although both men carried guns and made false statements upon their arrest, neither had a previous criminal record. On July 14, 1921, they were convicted and sentenced to die.
	- During the next few years, sporadic protests were held in Massachusetts and around the world calling for their release, especially after Celestino Madeiros, then under a sentence for murder, confessed in 1925 that he had participated in the crime with the Joe Morelli gang. The state Supreme Court refused to upset the verdict, and Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller denied the men clemency. In the days leading up to the execution, protests were held in cities around the world, and bombs were set off in New York City and Philadelphia. On August 23, Sacco and Vanzetti were electrocuted.
	- In 1961, a test of Sacco’s gun using modern forensic techniques apparently proved it was his gun that killed the guard, though little evidence has been found to substantiate Vanzetti’s guilt. In 1977, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation vindicating Sacco and Vanzetti, stating that they had been treated unjustly and that no stigma should be associated with their names.
- Throughout American history with the exception of the Chinese Immigration Act, immigrants were free to come to the US
- During WW1, no immigrants were allowed to come to the US
- After WW1, there was a big influx
- Emergency quota act
	- 3%
