Hello and good morning,  
  
My name is Rishit Arora and I am the Website Designer of eZsqueeZ out of Rockaway, New Jersey.  
  
eZsqueeZ is a flexible solution to the problem of a lack of morning meals. It is difficult to prepare, eat, and clean up after a filling breakfast in the short time in the morning before traveling to work or school. eZsqueeZ offers an alternative by providing all of the necessary ingredients for a day’s success: protein, vitamins, nutrients, and healthy carbohydrates, all in an easy-to-go, portable pouch. The pouch is created from a biodegradable plastic that is eco-friendly and easily recycled into further causes. This product is a great and viable way to start your day.  
  
If you are interested in making a purchase, please let me know, and I can put you in touch with our sales team.  
Or, place your order via our website at https://ezsqueezofficial.wixsite.com/ezsqueez

Thank you for your time and consideration,  
  
Rishit Arora
