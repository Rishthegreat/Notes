### Reduction of Tonal Propeller Noise by Means of Uneven Blade Spacing
- Harmonic/Tonal Noise
	- Created just by spinning
	- As Blade Passage Frequency increases, tonal noise increases
	- Thickness of blade, lift, and drag induced noise
- Narrow-Band Noise
	- Periodic motion of propeller blades in unsteady flow conditions
	- Propeller axis is misaligned with flow
- Broadband Noise
	- Interaction with turbulence
	- Found at all frequencies

- Current ways to reduce are to find individual noise source and reducing their impact
	- tonal - thinner blade sections, tip speed, changing blade number, blade length, etc
	- broadband - controlling turbulent vortices
	- Create significant design changes, losses in efficency and outweight the benefits in noise reduction
