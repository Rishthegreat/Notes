---
#### Prior to [[Spanish-American War]]
- In the Early 18th century, the first American traders came to Hawaii to exploit the island's sandalwood, which was highly valuable in China
- In the 1830s, the sugar industry was introduced to Hawaii and by the mid-19th centry, it had become very well established
- American missionaries and planters brought great changes in Hawaiian political, cultural, economical, and religious life, and in 1840, a constitutional monarchy was established, stripping the Hawaiian monarch of much of his authority
- In the next 4 decades, Hawaii entered into many treaties with the US and in 1887, [[Pearl Harbor]] was established
