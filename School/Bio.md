**Bio Video Script Notes**
- Here are the internal structures of 2 cells, the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) the CD4+ naive T-cell which will be activated by the end of this pathway
- There are 2 main signals needed to activate the T-cell. This is the First one.
- The APC, has a structure called the Major Histocompatibility Complex type 2, which presents the antigen ligand as a peptide
- The T-cell has a similar structure called the T-Cell Receptor (TCR)
- Once TCR interacts with the peptide and MHC, the CD4 protein made up of 4 subunits interacts with the beta chain of the MHC molecule and assits in stablizing the reaction

**1st signal**
- MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) Class 2 presents the antigen as a peptide
- T-cell receptor on the T-cell interacts with the MHC molecule and the peptide

**Proteins on the surface**
- Zeta protein chains (In homodimer form) are present which have 3 ITAMs on each chain
- CD3 protein exists as heterodimer form as CD3 Epsilon and CD3 Delta
	- 1 ITAM on each chain
- Another CD3 protein exists as heterodimer form as CD3 Epsilon and CD3 Gamma
	- 1 ITAM on each chain
- 1 Trans-membrane protein called the Linker for Activation of T-Cells (LAT)
- CD4 Protein made up of 4 subunits as D1, D2, D3, and D4
	- Interacts with the beta chain of the the MHC molecule and stabilizes the interaction

**2nd Costiumulatory signal**
- Between CD28 protein of T-cell and B7 protein on the APC

- Because of this, LCK gets attached to the cytoplasmic tail of the CD4 protein
	- Lymphocyte Tyrosine Kinase (LCK) phosphorylates the ITAM domains in the zeta chain
