- Due to these differences, 
- The most important thing is the Germany is given the sole responsibility of the War
	- Pay $33 billion dollars in war reparations
	- Disarm its military
	- Stripped of colonies
	- Lost national territory
	- French occupation of the Rhineland for 15 years
- People like Hitler hated this
