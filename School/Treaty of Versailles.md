- The Big 4 who had a lot of influence over the treaty were US, France, Italy, and Britain

- Wilson and the rest of the allies had different goals

- Due to these differences, many of Wilsonâ€™s ideas did not make it into the treaty (compromise after compromise)
	- Only 4 of them did
		- League of nations also made it in
- The most important thing is the Germany is given the sole responsibility of the War
	- Pay $33 billion dollars in war reparations
	- Disarm its military
	- Stripped of colonies
	- Lost national territory
	- French occupation of the Rhineland for 15 years
- Germany could not survive with all this load on its back and its already suffering
- People like Hitler hated this
- Many historians believe that this sets up an angry Germany for [[WW2]]

- Other results of the treaty
	- Territory taken from Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Turks
	- New Nations in Europe
	- League of Nations
		- Wilson believed that through the League of Nations, some of the shortcomings of the treaty could be solved
