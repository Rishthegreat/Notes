### Persian Gulf War
- Iraqi Dictator, Saddam Hussein invaded oil rich Kuwait on August 1990
	- Justified it publically by saying that Kuwait used to be part of Iraq
- Threat to Western oil sources in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf
- UN Deadline to leave - Jan 15 (4 Months)
- Operation Desert Storm - half a million American trrops joined by 28 other nations
- 5 weeks of airstrikes and then only 100 hours on the ground - February 1991
- US stops short of driving Saddam Hussein from power - follow UN mandate to remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait and leave it at that
- This kicked the Vietnam syndrome because it showed the US military prowess
