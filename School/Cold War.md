# Cold War
---
### Background
#### Russia as a Communist
- Russia becomes communist during [[WW1]] in 1918
- This scares the US because they do not like this
	- The Red Scare
	- Persecute radicals
	- Deport citizens
	- Does not officialy recognize the Soviet Union in 1933
	- US thinks Stalin is evil
	- Allied with them out of necessity in [[WW2]]
- There is a lot of distrust between the allies and the Soviet Union
	- Racing to Berlin
	- Dropping bomb to show power over the Soviets

#### Yalta Conference - 1945
- FDR is alive for 2 more months
- Germany is divided into occupation zones
- Free elections in the liberation countries in Eastern Europe (Currently under Soviet control)
	- US does not think that the Soviets are going to leave the countries in Eastern Europe ebcause they were under the control of the Red Army
	- Especially concerned about Poland
- A new world peace organization would be formed at a conference in San Francisco
- Soviets would enter war against Japan
	- In exchange for Kurile Islands in Pacific, southern half of Sakhalin Island and special concessions in Manchuria and control of key seaports in Manchuria
		- Offered incentives to enter the war against Japan
		- US kinda sold out its ally, the Chinese by giving away their islands and land
	- Soviets declare Japan a day or 2 after the US drops the first bomb and only fought for roughly a week
- Some criticized this conference for giving the land away, but the US really wanted the Soviets to join the war

#### Post War Aims
- America learned from WW1 that the US should not be isolationist and instead promote world trade, build up the nations in Europe, and take advantage of capitalism
- On the other hand, the Soviets want to overthrow capitalism in as many countries as possible
	- Germany had attacked the Soviets 2 times in the last 25 years and the Soviets do not want to build up Germany and instead want to have a buffer zone between itself and Germany through the different European countries
- Europe is destroyed after WW2
	- Cities are bombed out
	- They will look toward American leadership and help
	- Really only 2 countries with the most influence
		- US and Soviets
		- The US is more powerful due to boom in economy, best military in the world
		- The Soviets also were destroyed and were not economically very stable

#### Postwar Cooperation
- Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July, 1944 - Conference during the War
	- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
		- Regulate currency exchange rates
	- World Bank
		- Original purpose to rebuild war torn Europe
		- Loans to developing nations
		- Soviets decline to participate
	- Both are still around today
- US ends Lend Lease aid to Soviets, denies reconstruction loans
	- Tension because the loans were given to the British
##### UN
- April 1945 in San Francisco (FDR dead for about 2 weeks)
- UN General Assembly - legislative body
- UN Security Council - “action agency”
	- 15 countries
	- US, Great Britain, France, China, and Soviets
		- Permanent seats and veto power
	- Other seats are rotated with other nations
- Plans for Atomic Energy Comission
	- Bernard Baruch (American) proposed all atomic weapons and energy run by the UN
		- Some say that this was a missed opportunity
		- US did not want to veto because it was the only nation with the power and it did not want to give away the power
		- Soviets wanted to develop their own weapons and felt that the US would still have power over the Soviets in the UN
	- Rejected by US and Soviet for eliminating nuclear weapons and regulating nuclear energy, free from UN veto
- Food and Agricultural Administration, World Haalth, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)
##### Nuremberg Trials 1945 - 1949
- Decided at the Postdam Conference
- Came up with a code because each country has differing laws
	- International tribunal laws
	- London Charter
- Document the horrors of the Holocaust
- Put Germans on trial for war crimes
	- Some say that they are legally blurry
		- What the generals at the time of the crimes, were not considered crimes
		- The allies also commited war crimes and killed many civillians
- This set a precedent as it set law to put future criminals on trial
##### Tokyo War Crimes
- Not as popular as the Nuremberg
- Main person to be put on trial was the military leader
- Did not take pictures because the person in charge of the trials defied Truman when the emperor wished not to have pictures because of their culture

### Cold War Begining

#### The Ideological Struggle
| Soviet & Eastern Bloc Nations (“Iron Curtain”) | US & the Western Democracies                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal → Spread Worldwide Communism              | Goal → “Containment” of Communism & the eventual collapse of the Communist world |
| Warsaw Pact                                    | NATO                                                                                 |
**Methodologies**
- Ideological Competition for the minds and hearts of Third World peoples
- Proxy Wars
- Bi-Polarization of Europe
	- NATO vs Warsaw Pact
- Arms Race (Nuclear escalation)

- After WW2 in the Yalta Conference
	- Germany is split into 4 zones
		- France, British, Soviets, US
		- The allies want to build up Germany
		- Soviets want to keep Germany weak
	- Berlin, which is in the Soviet occupation zone, is also broken into 4 zone
- Soviet Satellite States
	- Stalin does not leave, just like how Truman feared
	- 1946 to 1949
		- Soviets begin to interfere with the elections
	- Comunists spread over the Eastern nations and many people did not like this
	- “From Stettin in the Balkans, to Triste in the Adriatic, an **iron curtain** has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lies the ancient capitals of Central and Eastern Europe” - Sir Winston Churchill, 1946

- **George F. Kennan**
	- American diplomat stationed in Moscow
	- Sent a Long Telegram to the United States
	- Soviets are inherently expansionist
	- “Contain” the spread of communism around the globe
	- Until the 1990s, this shaped US foreign policy
		- It would be too risky to invade the Soviet Union or the satellite states directly

[[Truman Doctrine]] - 1947
- Containment in Action
- Set a interventionist trend

[[Marshal Plan]] - 1948
- Well recieved

#### Division of Berlin
- West Berlin is doing much better than Eastern Berlin
- Stalin hates this
- June 1948 - May 1949
- **Berlin Blockade**
	- First big Cold War crisis in the US
	- Stalin puts a blockade, trying to starve West Berlin and make the Americans leave
- **Airlift**
	- A plane landing in West Berlin for 11 months every few minutes
		- Dropped off supplies
		- After 11 months, Stalin lifts the blockade
	- One of the biggest US military undertakings
	- This is one of the biggest reasons he wins reelection in 1948
	- Popular in West Berlin as well

- First couple of years, the US is seeming to be winning the Cold War
- Now, this leads to 2 permanent division of Germany
	- West Germany and East Germany
	- They combine into 1 later on

#### Truman Recognizes Isreal (1948)
- British Palestine was mostly Islamic
- After WW2, there was a lot of sympathy for the Jews
- The UN then creates the Jewish state of Isreal
	- The original plan was to have Isreal and Palestine
	- Gave them a year to come up with governments, etc
- Palestine does not like that their land is being taken away
- Isreal wants more land
	- Isreal starts off with a war and wins the war against Palestine
- Truman recognizes Isreal
	- Many middle eastern nations do not like Isreal
	- US also has a lot of oil trade interests with these nations
	- Many advisors advised against this because it might create tensions with other Islamic states and harm trade
	- However, Truman believed it was the right thing to do

#### National Security Act (1947)
- Congress passes this Act
- Department of Defense
	- Secretary of Defense
	- Joint Chiefs of Staff
- National Security Council (NSC)
- Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
- The Pentagon was created in order to house the Department of Defense

#### NSC-68 (1950)
- Quadruple US government defense spending to 20% of GNP
- Alliances with non Communist nations
- Convince the American public that a arms build up was imperative
- Implemented during the **Korean War**

#### NATO and Warsaw
- This created a bipolarization of Europe
##### North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - 1949

- Denmark
- France
- Iceland
- Italy
- Luxemburg
- Netherlands
- Norway
- Portugal
- 1952: Greece and Turkey
- 1955: West Germany

##### Warsaw Pact (1955)
- In turn, the Soviets create their own pact to protect all nations under this

- The Soviets exploded its first atomic bomb in 1949
	- Creates a lot of fear in the US
	- The playing field has been leveled and leads to a massive arms race
- 3 years later, the US develops the development of the hydrogen-bomb in 1952
