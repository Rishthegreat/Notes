##### Russia as a Communist
- Russia becomes communist during [[WW1]] in 1918
- This scares the US because they do not like this
	- The Red Scare
	- Persecute radicals
	- Deport citizens
	- Does not officialy recognize the Soviet Union in 1933
	- US thinks Stalin is evil
	- Allied with them out of necessity in [[WW2]]
- There is a lot of distrust between the allies and the Soviet Union
	- Racing to Berlin
	- Dropping bomb to show power over the Soviets

##### Yalta Conference - 1945
- FDR is alive for 2 more months
- Germany is divided into occupation zones
- Free elections in the liberation countries in Eastern Europe (Currently under Soviet control)
	- US does not think that the Soviets are going to leave the countries in Eastern Europe ebcause they were under the control of the Red Army
	- Especially concerned about Poland
- A new world peace organization would be formed at a conference in San Francisco
- Soviets would enter war against Japan
	- In exchange for Kurile Islands in Pacific, southern half of Sakhalin Island and special concessions in Manchuria and control of key seaports in Manchuria
		- Offered incentives to enter the war against Japan
		- US kinda sold out its ally, the Chinese by giving away their islands and land
	- Soviets declare Japan a day or 2 after the US drops the first bomb and only fought for roughly a week
- Some criticized this conference for giving the land away, but the US really wanted the Soviets to join the war

##### Post War Aims
- America learned from WW1 that the US should not be isolationist and instead promote world trade, build up the nations in Europe, and take advantage of capitalism
- On the other hand, the Soviets want to overthrow capitalism in as many countries as possible
	- Germany had attacked the Soviets 2 times in the last 25 years and the Soviets do not want to build up Germany and instead want to have a buffer zone between itself and Germany through the different European countries
- Europe is destroyed after WW2
	- Cities are bombed out
	- They will look toward American leadership and help
	- Really only 2 countries with the most influence
		- US and Soviets
		- The US is more powerful due to boom in economy, best military in the world
		- The Soviets also were destroyed and were not economically very stable

##### Postwar Cooperation

	- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
		- Regulate currency exchange rates
	- World Bank

	- Tension because the loans were given to the British
###### UN
- April 1945 in San Francisco (FDR dead for about 2 weeks)
- UN General Assembly - legislative body
- UN Security Council - “action agency”
	- 15 countries
	- US, Great Britain, France, China, and Soviets
		- Permanent seats and veto power
	- Other seats are rotated with other nations
- Plans for Atomic Energy Comission
	- Bernard Baruch (American) proposed all atomic weapons and energy run by the UN
		- Some say that this was a missed opportunity
		- US did not want to veto because it was the only nation with the power and it did not want to give away the power
		- Soviets wanted to develop their own weapons and felt that the US would still have power over the Soviets in the UN
	- Rejected by US and Soviet for eliminating nuclear weapons and regulating nuclear energy, free from UN veto
