### Background
#### Russia as a Communist
- Russia becomes communist during [[WW1]] in 1918
- This scares the US because they do not like this
	- The Red Scare
	- Persecute radicals
	- Deport citizens
	- Does not officialy recognize the Soviet Union in 1933
	- US thinks Stalin is evil
	- Allied with them out of necessity in [[WW2]]
- There is a lot of distrust between the allies and the Soviet Union
	- Racing to Berlin
	- Dropping bomb to show power over the Soviets

#### Yalta Conference - 1945
- Held near Yalta in Crimea, Soviet Union
- FDR is alive for 2 more months
- Germany is divided into occupation zones
- Free elections in the liberation countries in Eastern Europe (Currently under Soviet control)
	- US does not think that the Soviets are going to leave the countries in Eastern Europe ebcause they were under the control of the Red Army
	- Especially concerned about Poland
- A new world peace organization would be formed at a conference in San Francisco
- Soviets would enter war against Japan
	- In exchange for Kurile Islands in Pacific, southern half of Sakhalin Island and special concessions in Manchuria and control of key seaports in Manchuria
		- Offered incentives to enter the war against Japan
		- US kinda sold out its ally, the Chinese by giving away their islands and land
	- Soviets declare Japan a day or 2 after the US drops the first bomb and only fought for roughly a week
- Some criticized this conference for giving the land away, but the US really wanted the Soviets to join the war

#### Post War Aims
- America learned from WW1 that the US should not be isolationist and instead promote world trade, build up the nations in Europe, and take advantage of capitalism
- On the other hand, the Soviets want to overthrow capitalism in as many countries as possible
	- Germany had attacked the Soviets 2 times in the last 25 years and the Soviets do not want to build up Germany and instead want to have a buffer zone between itself and Germany through the different European countries
- Europe is destroyed after WW2
	- Cities are bombed out
	- They will look toward American leadership and help
	- Really only 2 countries with the most influence
		- US and Soviets
		- The US is more powerful due to boom in economy, best military in the world
		- The Soviets also were destroyed and were not economically very stable

#### Postwar Cooperation
- Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July, 1944 - Conference during the War
	- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
		- Regulate currency exchange rates
	- World Bank
		- Original purpose to rebuild war torn Europe
		- Loans to developing nations
		- Soviets decline to participate
	- Both are still around today
- US ends Lend Lease aid to Soviets, denies reconstruction loans
	- Tension because the loans were given to the British
##### UN
- Established in an attempt to maintain international peace and security and to achieve cooperation among nations on economic, social, and humanitarian problems.
- April 1945 in San Francisco (FDR dead for about 2 weeks)
- UN General Assembly - legislative body
- UN Security Council - “action agency”
	- 15 countries
	- US, Great Britain, France, China, and Soviets
		- Permanent seats and veto power
	- Other seats are rotated with other nations
- Plans for Atomic Energy Comission
	- Bernard Baruch (American) proposed all atomic weapons and energy run by the UN
		- Some say that this was a missed opportunity
		- US wanted to veto because it was the only nation with the power and it did not want to give away the power
		- Soviets wanted to develop their own weapons and felt that the US would still have power over the Soviets in the UN
	- Rejected by US and Soviet for eliminating nuclear weapons and regulating nuclear energy, free from UN veto
- Food and Agricultural Administration, World Health, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)
##### Nuremberg Trials 1945 - 1949
- Decided at the Postdam Conference
- Came up with a code because each country has differing laws
	- International tribunal laws
	- London Charter
- Document the horrors of the Holocaust
- Put Germans on trial for war crimes
	- Some say that they are legally blurry
		- What the generals at the time of the crimes, were not considered crimes
		- The allies also commited war crimes and killed many civillians
- This set a precedent as it set law to put future criminals on trial
##### Tokyo War Crimes
- May 1946 to November 1948
- Not as popular as the Nuremberg
- Main person to be put on trial was the military leader
- Did not take pictures because the person in charge of the trials defied Truman when the emperor wished not to have pictures because of their culture

### Cold War Begining
___

#### The Ideological Struggle
| Soviet & Eastern Bloc Nations (“Iron Curtain”) | US & the Western Democracies                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal → Spread Worldwide Communism              | Goal → “Containment” of Communism & the eventual collapse of the Communist world |
| Warsaw Pact                                    | NATO                                                                                 |
**Methodologies**
- Ideological Competition for the minds and hearts of Third World peoples
- Proxy Wars
- Bi-Polarization of Europe
	- NATO vs Warsaw Pact
- Arms Race (Nuclear escalation)

- After WW2 in the Yalta Conference
	- Germany is split into 4 zones
		- France, British, Soviets, US
		- The allies want to build up Germany
		- Soviets want to keep Germany weak
	- Berlin, which is in the Soviet occupation zone, is also broken into 4 zone
- Soviet Satellite States
	- Stalin does not leave, just like how Truman feared
	- 1946 to 1949
		- Soviets begin to interfere with the elections
	- Comunists spread over the Eastern nations and many people did not like this
	- “From Stettin in the Balkans, to Triste in the Adriatic, an **iron curtain** has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lies the ancient capitals of Central and Eastern Europe” - Sir Winston Churchill, 1946

- **George F. Kennan**
	- American diplomat stationed in Moscow
	- Sent a Long Telegram to the United States
	- Soviets are inherently expansionist
	- “Contain” the spread of communism around the globe
	- Until the 1990s, this shaped US foreign policy
		- It would be too risky to invade the Soviet Union or the satellite states directly

[[Truman Doctrine]] - 1947
- Containment in Action
- Set a interventionist trend

[[Marshal Plan]] - 1948
- Well recieved

#### Division of Berlin
- West Berlin is doing much better than Eastern Berlin
- Stalin hates this
- June 1948 - May 1949
- **Berlin Blockade**
	- First big Cold War crisis in the US
	- Stalin puts a blockade, trying to starve West Berlin and make the Americans leave
- **Airlift**
	- A plane landing in West Berlin for 15 months every few minutes
		- Dropped off supplies
		- After 11 months, Stalin lifts the blockade
	- One of the biggest US military undertakings
	- This is one of the biggest reasons he wins reelection in 1948
	- Popular in West Berlin as well

- First couple of years, the US is seeming to be winning the Cold War
- Now, this leads to 2 permanent division of Germany
	- West Germany and East Germany
	- They combine into 1 later on

	- Secretary of Defense
	- Joint Chiefs of Staff

- Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
- The Pentagon was created in order to house the Department of Defense

#### Truman Recognizes Isreal (1948)
- British Palestine was mostly Islamic
- After WW2, there was a lot of sympathy for the Jews
- The UN then creates the Jewish state of Isreal
	- The original plan was to have Isreal and Palestine
	- Gave them a year to come up with governments, etc
- Palestine does not like that their land is being taken away
- Isreal wants more land
	- Isreal starts off with a war and wins the war against Palestine
	- The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 broke out when five Arab nations invaded territory in the former Palestinian mandate immediately following the announcement of the independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948.
- Truman recognizes Isreal
	- Many middle eastern nations do not like Isreal
	- US also has a lot of oil trade interests with these nations
	- Many advisors advised against this because it might create tensions with other Islamic states and harm trade
	- However, Truman believed it was the right thing to do

#### NSC-68 (1950)
- Quadruple US government defense spending to 20% of GNP
- Alliances with non Communist nations

- The Soviets exploded its first atomic bomb in 1949
	- Creates a lot of fear in the US
	- The playing field has been leveled and leads to a massive arms race
- 3 years later, the US develops the development of the hydrogen-bomb in 1952
- Soon after in 1955, the Soviets also develop their own hydrogen bomb

### Cold War in Asia
- There will be much more failures for the US in Asia
#### American Occupation of Japan
- Controlled until 1951
- Best way to get rid of US is for Japan to cooperate
- Forced a democratic government with more freedoms for citizens and women in general
- Japan could invest in the industry since they did not have to maintain their army because the US was there
- Deemed as successful and became one of US’s strongest allies
#### Communist China
- Prior to WW2, there is a civil war in China
	- Current Nationalist leader is Chiang Kai-Shek
	- The Nationalist government is fighting against communist Mao Zedong
		- Most Chinese support Mao Zedong because most of them are peasants
	- The current government is also pretty corrupt
- US does not want China to turn communist, but it does not want to enter a war
	- It gives some money to the nationalist government, but since it was corrupt, 80% of that money goes to the communist
- In 1949, China becomes communist
	- Some people said that Truman was weak on communism and it was his fault that China fell
		- “Truman lost China”
		- This decreased Truman’s popularity a bit
- Chiang Kai-Shek fled to Taiwan and until the 1970s, Taiwan was recognized as the government of China
#### Korean War - 1950 to 1953
- [[Korean War]] 
	- First proxy War
	- Truman leaves in 1952 after his term as one of the lowest approval ratings in history due to how the Americans viewed him as “soft” on communism
	- Sparked massive military defensive spending against communism
		- [[Cold War#NSC-68 (1950)]]
	- Eisenhower during the election said that if elected, he will go to Korea and end the war, and an armstice was signed soon after his election
		- However, a major reason for that signing is the death of Stalin

### Domestic Fear of Communism
#### Second Red Scare (1947-1954)

| Anti-Union sentiment and laws                                                                                                            | Not much anti-union sentiment, though it is prevalent             |
| -                                                                                                                                        | Much more Large Scale                                             |
| Not in a war against any country                                                                                                         | Fear of being bombed by the soviets, massive scale investigations |
