Spanish Story
- I am a pilot who is flying a plane from United States to Spain
- While on the way, lights start flickering and the tv in the plane starts showing static
- A blue light from the top shines in and aliens start taking over the plane
- I initiate a lockdown and leave the plane on autopilot as the flight starts to nosedive
- I am trained in multiple martial arts and begin to silently assassinate the aliens
- When the last one is left, he sees me kill his partner and we get into a fight
- I almost die, but my copilot stabs him in the end
- Few seconds before the plane crashes, I get back to the cockpit and being to fly the plane
- We all land safely in Spain
