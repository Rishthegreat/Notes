- These reactions are used to create macromolecules
- The subcomponents of a water molecule (Hydrogen and Hydroxide) are removed from interacting monomers and a covalent bond forms between them
- The subcomponents join together to form a molecute of water (water is a byproduct)
- So by the end of this, we end up with a water molecule and a polymer
