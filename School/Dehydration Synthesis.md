# Dehydration Synthesis
---

- These reactions are used to create macromolecules
- The subcomponents of a water molecule (Hydrogen and Hydroxide) are removed from interacting monomers and a covalent bond forms between them
- The subcomponents join together to form a molecute of water (water is a byproduct)
- So by the end of this, we end up with a water molecule and a polymer

#### Examples
![[Dehydration Synthesis 2022-11-17 21.12.48.excalidraw]]
- Carbohydrate monomers have hydroxides and hydrogen atoms attached to them
- One monomer will lose an entire hydroxide while the other will only lose a hydrogen from a hydroxide

#### A Dehydration Synthesis Creates Proteins
- Protein monomers are called amino acids
- Each amino acid has an amino group $NH_2$ terminus and a carboxyl group $COOH$ terminus
- A Hydoxide is lost from the carboxyl group of one amino acid an hydrogen atom is lost from the aminno group of another amino acid

- Covalent bond will form between the monomers in the location where the hydroxide and hydrogen atom were removed

- The hydroxide and hydrogen atom will become water
