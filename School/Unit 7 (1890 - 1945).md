## Why did the US begin to pursue imperialistic enterprises at the end of the 19th century?

- For the most part, The US was following Washington's advice on foreign affairs and not making permanent alliances with other countries
	- The [[Monroe Doctrine]] came after the [[War of 1812]], but Europeans did not really respect it
		- The idea of the doctrine was important
- The Western Frontier closed in 1890 - [[Closing of the Western Frontier]]
	- Since we cannot go west, we go looking for new land and new markets elsewhere - [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]
- Imperialism itself was a cause
	- The US was late to the imperialism party
		- [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 1880s
		- Did not want to get left behind because they wanted to be a global power
- US interests
	- Military/strategic interests
		- Alfred Mahan's [[The Influence of Sea Power on History]]
	- Religious / Missionary interests
		- [[Social Darwinism]] thinking
			- The usage of science to support theories of racial heiarchies

- The US officially imperializes during the [[Spanish-American War]] when [[Hawaii becomes a territory]]
	- If the US wanted to become a powerful nation, they needed to imperialize other nations, but this idea went against their principles such as the consent of the governed
		- Imperializing benefits the nation when ignoring the morality
		- First major successful conflict after the Civil War and despite anti-imperialism, there was a lot of patriotism
