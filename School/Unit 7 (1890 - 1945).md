# Unit 7 (1890 - 1945)

## Main Idea - 
- After the Gilded Age and the end of Western Expansion, darwinist motives and economical advantages, the United States started to expand outside its borders
---
## Imperialism
## Why did the US begin to pursue imperialistic enterprises at the end of the 19th century?

- For the most part, The US was following Washington's advice on foreign affairs and not making permanent alliances with other countries
	- The [[Monroe Doctrine]] came after the [[War of 1812]], but Europeans did not really respect it
		- The idea of the doctrine was important
- The Western Frontier closed in 1890 - [[Closing of the Western Frontier]]
	- Since we cannot go west, we go looking for new land and new markets elsewhere - [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]
- Imperialism itself was a cause
	- The US was late to the imperialism party
		- [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 1880s
		- Did not want to get left behind because they wanted to be a global power
- US interests
	- Military/strategic interests
		- Alfred Mahan's [[The Influence of Sea Power on History]]
	- Religious / Missionary interests
		- [[Social Darwinism]] thinking
			- The usage of science to support theories of racial heiarchies
				- Using things such as IQ tests which can be biased
				- Other people will benefit fom American rule by bringing them liberty, and civilization because they are savages and we can save them
					- [[White Man's Burden]]
		- Josiah Strong's [[Our Country: Its Possible Future and Present Crisis]] 
		- Some missionaries were benevolent and truly believed that the people would benefit from becomeing Christian
		- Some forced Christianity on others
---
- Seward's Folly 1867
	- Purchased Alaska from Russia for 7.2 mil
		- Some people was no benefit from this and called this Seward's Icebox, but later gold and oil were discovered. Additionally it became a great source of fishing and lumber

- The US officially imperializes during the [[Spanish-American War]] when [[Hawaii becomes a territory]]
	- If the US wanted to become a powerful nation, they needed to imperialize other nations, but this idea went against their principles such as the consent of the governed
		- Imperializing benefits the nation when ignoring the morality
		- First major successful conflict after the Civil War and despite anti-imperialism, there was a lot of patriotism
- For 3 years after the War, the US troops remain in Cuba until 1901
	- This improved the roads and infrastructure of Cuba
- In 1901, Cubans write their own Constitution
	- US forces Cuba to add the [[Platt Amendment]] to their Constitution

#### Does US citizenship follow the flag?
- If the US controls a territory, do the people there also have the same rights as US citizens
- 1900 - Foraker Act
	- Puerto Rico became and "unincorporated territory"
	- Citizens of Puerto Rico, not the US
- 1901 - 1903 - The Insular (island) cases
	- Constitutional rights were not automatically extended to territorial possessions
- 1917 - Jones Act
	- Act of Congress granted US citizenship and limited self-government
- Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Phillipines were all added at the same time, but not all have the same rights - Congress determines this

#### Philippine - American War
- Limited options
	- US did not want to give the Philippines back to Spain
	- US did not want to leave the Philippines
		- Other nations might have taken over the Philippines
			- Evidence that Germany might have done that
		- McKinley thought that the people of the Philippines were unfit to self-govern
			- "Benevolent Assimilation" - McKinley
- First colonial war where the US was the oppressors
	- Similar tactics to what the Spanish used against the Cubans
	- This is what the anti-imperialists feared and did not want the Philippines to fall under US control
	- Roughly 200,000 Filipino US died
- Emilio Aguinaldo captured in 1902, officially ending the War in July 4 1902
- US rules the Philippines until WW2 when the Japanese take over.
- William H. Taft - 1st Gov. General of the Philippines (In charge of the Philippines)
	- He becomes the president
	- famously called the Filipino - "My little brown brothers"
- US becomes an imperial power, especially in the Pacific region

#### Benefits of American rule
- Ecocomic benefits
	- More industrialization
	- More jobs and industries
- Democratic nations
- US is the military so no need to spend money on it
	- After WW2, US controlled Germany and Japan and that is the main reason they are successful today, because they did not have to put money into their military and could focus on economic development
- Building a lot of infrastructure
	- Schools, hospitals, trains, roads

#### Interest in China
- China had a large population with lots of potential
- Philippines was a stepping stone to China
	- Close to China with major ports and a huge market in Asia
- Just lost a war to Japan and was very vulnerable
- China had different regions where different imperialist nations had set up protectorates
	- Spheres of influence
- The US wants in to this market
- Secretary of State John Hay
	- Releases a note to the other European imperialist nations
		- "The Open Door Policy"
		- Give all nations equal access to trade in China

		- This was hailed a diplomatic triumph in the US despite many nations not even replying and some saying that they would only abide if other nations do the same
- Opposing Western Influence
	- [[The Boxer Rebellion]]
		- This leads John Hay to release his second note
			- Preserve territorial integrity of China
			- "Equal and impartial trade" - Commercial integrity
- At this time, Japan starts to emerge as a rival to the US because of their imperialist nature and their interest in China

#### Election of 1900
