#### Cell Communication 4.1

**Biological Pathway** - Series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in the cell. It can trigger the assembly of new molecules, such as a fat or protein, turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move

##### How do they work?
- Cells are constantly receiving chemical cues prompted by things like injuries, infection, stress or even the presence or lack of food
- Cells send and recieve signals through biological pathways
- The moleucles that make up the pathway interact with signals, as well as with each other, to do their task
- Pathways can act over **long distances** or **short distances**
	- Send signals to nearby cells to repair localized damage
	- Hormones that travel through blood to a target cell
- Some affect how body proceses drugs. Others can maintain balance, control how the pupil dialates, etc
- When something goes wrong, the result can be a disease like cancer or diabetes
