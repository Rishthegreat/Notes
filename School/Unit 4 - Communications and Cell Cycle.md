#### Cell Communication 4.1

**Biological Pathway** - Series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in the cell. It can trigger the assembly of new molecules, such as a fat or protein, turn genes on and off, or spur a cell to move

##### How do they work?
- Cells are constantly receiving chemical cues prompted by things like injuries, infection, stress or even the presence or lack of food
- Cells send and recieve signals through biological pathways
- The moleucles that make up the pathway interact with signals, as well as with each other, to do their task
- Pathways can act over **short distances (juxtacrine/direct signaling)**, **medium distances (paracine signaling)**, or **long distances (endocrine signaling)**
- Some affect how body proceses drugs. Others can maintain balance, control how the pupil dialates, etc
- When something goes wrong, the result can be a disease like cancer or diabetes

##### Types of Pathways
- Most well-known are pathways involved in metabolism, in the regulation of genes and in the transmission of signals
	- **Metabolic Pathways**
		- eg - process by which cells break down food into energy molecules that can be stored for later use
	- **Gene Regulation Pathways**
		- Turn genes on and off
			- Genes provide instruction to build proteins
	- **Signal Transduction Pathways**
		- Move a signal from a cell’s exterior to its interior
		- Receive specific signals through structures on their surfaces called receptors
		- Singal travels into the cell and transmitted by special proteins that trigger a specific reaction in the cell

- **Biological Network** - When multiple biological pathways interact with each other

#### Introduction to Signal Transduction 4.2
**Reasons to Communicate**
- Regulate its own or another cell’s growth
- Coordinate movement with other cells
- Alter its own or another cell’s metabolism
- Cause another cell to die
- Altering expression of certain genes
- Remodeling the cell’s cytoskeleton
- Changing the concentration of cellular ions and small molecules
- Activating or deactivating certain enzymes

	- Examples
	- 2 cells that are growing close together can signal to each other to stop growing through interactions of proteins on their surfaces
		- Eg: Skin cells interact through a protein called E-cadherin on their surface

	- Examples
		- A signaling neuron communicates with a target neuron by releasing small molecules called neurotransmitters into the space between the two cells (synapse)
			- One example of a neurotransmitter is serotonin

	- ![[Pasted image 20230207232852.png|225]]
	- Examples
		- From the Adrenal gland, epinephrine hormone is produced and released into the blodstream
		- This hormone signals cells in the liver to break down glycogen into glucose, producing elevated blood glucose levels. It also stimulates target cells in the lungs and in the heart to increase the respiratory rate and heart rate

#### Signal Transduction 4.3

- This example shows how the cholera toxin causes the epithelial cells to release ions and water, causing diarrhea
- Arrows indicate that the next step is going to be “activated” or “more likely to occur”
- If the enkephalin activates the opioid receptor, the receptor will activate another G-protein (not the same, but from the same family of G-proteins) and it will inhibit the process of adenylate cyclase binding to the G-protein.
- The line with the bar at the end instead of arrow indicates inhibition

- In **Signal Transduction**, a series of relay proteins inside the cytoplasm of the target cells activate target proteins, resulting in a cellular response.
	- Complex due to interplay between proteins
	- [[Phosphorylation]] is very important
		- This changes the shape of the protein and then activates or deactivates them
- Second messengers like cAMP and $Ca^{2+}$ are often used to transmit signals within a cell
- When a ligand binds to its receptor, conformational changes occur that affect the receptor’s intracellular domain. 
- This change propogates through the membrane region of the receptor and leads
