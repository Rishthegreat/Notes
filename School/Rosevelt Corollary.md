- A lot of smaller nations owned debts to other larger nations
	- EG - Venezuela owned money to GErmany and Germany used gunboats to take over the country
	- The same thing was happening in The Dominic Republic
- "Chronic wrongdoing... may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation"
	- If there is a situation where the Latin America countries owe money, the United States would send gunboats to take over custom houses and get the money because the US did not want a growing European influence in the Americas
- This is a justification for being able to control and involvement in the Latin American area
