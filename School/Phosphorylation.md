# Phosphorylation
---

Phosphate groups canâ€™t be attached to just any part of a protein. Instead, they are typically linked to one of the three amino acids that have hydroxl groups in their side chains: tyrosine, threonine, and serine. The transfer of the phosphate group is catalyzed by an enzyme called a kinase, and cells contain many different kinases that phosphorylate different targets. Phosphorylation often acts as a switch, but its effects vary among proteins. Sometimes, phosphorylation will make a protein more active (for instance, increasing catalysis or letting it bind to a partner). It can also cause a protein to be deactivated or cause it to be broken down
- This process is not permanent. To flip proteins back into their non-phosphorylated state, cells have enzymes called phosphatases, which remove a phosphate group from their targets
