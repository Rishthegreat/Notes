**Cosmic Rays**
- Earth is bombarded by particles from outer space
- At the surface of the earth, there is roughly 1 particle per second on a hand
primary cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere
	Most of them are muons (and neutrinos)
		Lightest particles containing quarks eg pion are produced which then decay to make muons and neutrinos
 - Cosmic Rays discovered in 1912 by Victor Hess
- Cosmic Rays are responsible for 
Thunderstorms
Formation of upper atmosphere clouds
Hefty radiation close ot those flying at high altitudes over the pole
- As energy of cosmic rays increases, flux decreases, flux - Particles that hit the earth
- What are cosmic Rays?
	-  Protons
	- electrons
	- neutrinos
	- photos
	- nuclei
- They travel a long distance to get to us
- Not neutrons because their lifetime is roughly only 15 minutes
- Low energy cosmic rays mostly come from the sun
- Earth's magnetic field bends the cosmic flux and protects us
- Cosmic rays greater than 1 GeV must be galactic because the sun is not energetic enough to accelerate them
	- Prime suspect - the most energetic thing in the galaxy (supernova)
	- The energy released is so great that is accounts for the galactic cosmic rays
- Why do these galactic rays come from all around earth rather than just from a point source
	- This is due to magnetic fields that scramble the direction of the particles
- Max energy that can be accelerated is limited by the size of the system and the value of the magnetic field
- The even more massive cosmic rays come from super massive black holes at center of galaxies that spew out massive amounts of energy
- Does the energy keep getting higher?
There should be a brick wall at 6 x 10^19 eV
At this energy, the universe becomes opaque due to interaction with the CMB


**Quantum Computing**
- Computation - you take an input and the computer applies some rules to it to get an output (manupulating information)
	- In a closed system information is neither created nor destroyed
- The evolution of the universe is a computation
	- The information in a physical system evolves from an input state to an output state following the laws of physics (The equation of motion)
- In a classical universe, the state of a particle can be reprensented as its position and its velocity (This can be represented by classical bits)
- In a quantum universe, you start with a specific state and you can get an output using the Shrodinger's equation and can be represented by quibits for certain system
	- Si of x is the wave function that tells us the position
	- Sqiggle si of x is the function that tells us the momentum
	- You cannot know both
- Our brains only deal with classical information
	- So the input that we give to the computer and the output that we recieve has to be in bits
	- The ouput of a quantum computer is in the form of quibits, but when we measure it, out answer is in the form of bits
	- So, we have to be clever in how we want to take advantage of the quantum computer

- Superposition - 
	- quibits are in a superposition of 0 and 1
	- The general state of a quibit is in the state alpha times 0 + beta times 1
	- If a quibit is in the state 0 + 1, it does not mean that it is in the states 0 and 1 simultaneosly. It is in a definite state that is in a superposition of 0 and 1
	- By putting the quibit in a superposition of 0 and 1, the quantum computer can operate on the bit being 0 and being 1 at the same time
- Exponentially large space - 
	- a system of n quibits represents 2^n numbers at the same
- Entanglement
	- quibits have "spooky" non-local correlations with each other

- Electron Spin
	- An electron has internal angular momentum (Spin)
		- Like a spinning top
	- The magnitude of the spin is fixed
	- It is siilar to the internal mass and charge that an electron carries
	- The difference is that spin has a direction. It is as if the electron carries an arrow hat can point in any direction


**Particle Physics**
- Most particle physics experiments come from the gold foil experiment
	- Some materials emit light when charged particles traverse them
		- This is still one of the two main methods of experimental particle detection

- How do we accelerate charged particles?
	- Use battery and create an electrial potential drop over 2 metal plates

- Why is there a heiarchy of masses?
- Why W and Z bosons have mass while the photos in massless

 - The Higgs Boson was a way to give particles mass
	 - The particles interact with the Higgs field and they move more slowly which leads us to conclude that they have mass.
	 - The Higgs boson is not needed for a particle to interact with the Higgs Field

- The Higgs boson is unstable and decays very quickly
	- 0.2% decays into 2 photons
	- 0.014% decays into 4 electrons or muons
	- 99.8% decays are harder to observe
