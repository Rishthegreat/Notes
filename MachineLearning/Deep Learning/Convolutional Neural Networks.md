**Convolutional Neural Networks**

- To the CNN, a black and white image that is 2 x 2 is a 2d array with each value being $0\le$ pixel value $\le255$
	- Then the computer is able to work with the image
- To the CNN, a colored image that is 2 x 2 is a 3d array because of rgb

	- Convolutional operation

	- You take the Feature Detector aka Kernel aka Filter and apply it to the image
		- Usually the Filter is 3 x 3 bu some use 5 x 5, etc
